       "  {'ad_creative_body': 'ONE FINAL BATTLE TO SAVE THE ALAMO CENOTAPH\\n\\nLee White, President and Founder of the Alamo Defenders Descendants Association sent us this plea.\\n\\n“The direct descendants of the Alamo are fighting as our ancestors once did against tyranny. The politicians didn’t deliver safety for the Alamo Cenotaph nor insurance that the Defender story wouldn’t be diminished.\\n\\n“Folks! This is the last stand . . .\\n“Will you come to our aid or will it end as it did in 1836? We can prevail in Federal Court but we need funds. Please send what you can as the enemy are upon us. Share this post and donate.\\n\\nMake out checks or money orders to:\\nAlamo Defenders Descendants Association \\nMailing address:\\nLee White\\nP.O. Box 856\\nFreer, Texas 78357\\n“Together we can win!”\\n\\nBecause we have fought for three years to save the Alamo—and the Cenotaph specifically—from the indignities that George P. Bush’s Reimagine the Alamo plan entails, we have agreed to support the Alamo Defenders Descendants Association’s (ADDA) effort.\\n\\nTo give newcomers a thumbnail sketch of our fight, I will highlight the details.\\n\\n1) While we don’t object to all elements of the plan, when we learned that Texas General Land Office (GLO) Commissioner Bush planned not to only restore or repair the Alamo complex, but to reimagine it instead, at a cost of $450 million, our campaign began.\\n\\n2) First, we created a social media and public media campaign to let all Texans understand that the shrine could be respectfully restored for about one-tenth the cost and the plan to do so already existed. Building a social media platform and attracting followers takes time—time we didn’t have. Moreover, most of our appeals to public media fell on deaf ears.\\n\\n3) In the 2018 Texas Election, George P. Bush again ran for Texas GLO Commissioner. Defeating him would have halted the Reimagine plan, but that did not happen. We asked for your financial support to broadcast our message statewide, but only a few generous followers responded. That effort failed—Bush’s plan moved forward.\\n\\n4) We tried again whenever several monument protection bills were presented to the 86th Texas Legislature in 2019. Thanks to tremendous response from our followers who wrote, emailed, and called Texas officials when we asked, we got one perfect bill that had passed through the Senate, a House committee, and awaited a spot on the calendar for House floor vote. Political betrayal at the last moment killed the bill.\\n\\nAlongside us, Lee White and the ADDA campaigned against moving the Cenotaph with good reason. In 2014, the General Land Office commissioned an analysis of the fitness of the Alamo Cenotaph. In that report, it was considered in good condition and should be restored in place rather than moved. George P. Bush took office in 2015 and had other plans. That restoration didn’t happen.\\n\\nEven though that report warned against irreparable damage if it were moved, Bush’s Reimagine plan calls for the Cenotaph to be moved from its present location—in front of the Long Barracks where the Alamo defenders made their last stand, and where most of them died—to an area to the south that is completely outside the Alamo perimeter. \\n\\nIn her tireless effort, Lee discovered State Health and Safety Code, Chapter 711 whereby any piece of land can be officially designated as an “unverified cemetery” if it contains human remains or unmarked graves. Such designation invokes mandatory regulations that would prevent moving the Cenotaph. Bush’s people opposed that designation of Alamo Plaza at a recent Texas Historical Commission (THC) meeting, stating that if so designated, it would stop them from implementing the Reimagine the Alamo Master Plan. The THC therefore denied the official designation as Bush requested, instead granting “honorary cemetery” status that lacks all the stringent requirements.\\nThe Plaza qualifies under the terms of the Chapter 711 state law, since numerous verified human remains have been found in archaeological excavations, some of them likely remains of the Alamo defenders. In addition, upwards of 1,500 mission Indians are buried in unmarked graves in the Plaza as documented in the Alamo Mission Spanish Inventories. \\n\\nAs bloodline descendants of the Alamo defenders, Lee White and the ADDA have legal standing to file this action in both State and Federal District Courts. We do not. They plan to file in Federal Court, and if the case proceeds to trial, they will invoke their right to a trial by JURY. As part of this lawsuit, they will seek a Temporary Injunction (TI) to prevent any action by Bush against the Alamo Cenotaph pending resolution of the case in court on the merits. Once applied for, a TI is considered an emergency by the court and is ruled on almost immediately. If granted, the TI will place a mantle of protection over the Cenotaph throughout the life of the case, including any appeals.\\n\\nLee has engaged an excellent law firm at a greatly reduced rate. Nonetheless, going to court costs money. The lawyers have done the background work and made all preparations to file the lawsuit. Lee must have an additional $10,000 IN HAND to file the suit and the application for the protective injunction. This may sound like a lot of money, and it is. \\n\\nWhat is it worth to you to save the Alamo Cenotaph? If all of you claiming to care about the Alamo donate, we could raise this amount virtually overnight. Don’t send ME anything. But please send something to Lee—no matter the amount. For those of you who can afford it, please dig deep and be as generous as possible. We have the facts and the law on our side in this case; the only thing that we lack is funding. \\n\\nWe can rant and rave on Facebook, but that will accomplish nothing—aside from venting ire. We are way past phone calls, letters, and emails. What we now need from you is action—and that means donate MONEY. The only thing that will affect Bush at this point is a ruling by a Court of Law. \\n\\nFriends, if we do not generously support Lee in this effort, it is over. If we DO support her, we have a very good chance of stopping this. That is the choice.\\n\\nIt is now up to you.\\n\\n-Rick Range\\n\\nP.S.—PLEASE SHARE THIS MESSAGE. And please send in your donation now. Each day the lawsuit and application for injunction remains unfiled is a day that the Alamo Cenotaph stands at risk—the clock is ticking. PLEASE ACT NOW.',\n",

This was a bipartisan conference with a select group of elected officials from Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Very impressed The White House is reaching out to all levels of government. As they say, “all politics is local” and it shows the President truly is interested in learning more about what is important to us local officials and how the Administration can be of service. Today wasn’t about partisan politics, it was about how the federal government can help all levels of government succeed in order to keep our economy strong. We discussed agriculture issues and how we can help our farmers during these tough times, we discussed workforce development, opportunity zones, infrastructure, and many important issues. Last but not least, I was invited to the West Wing and had the opportunity to tout everything Madison County, Illinois has to offer during a press conference on the North White House lawn. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence for taking the time to take a selfie, class act guy! So stay tuned to local news this evening.',\n",
