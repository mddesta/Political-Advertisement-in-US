Thanks for your support and please continue to visit our Facebook Page for news that matters.\\n\\nMedia Matters and leftists attack Tucker Carlson advertisers, influence HelloFresh, Nestle, Stein Mart, Long John Silver’s and others to stop advertising.  Will these same companies stop advertising with Comcast Cable, NBC and its other affiliates after NBC Universal Pictures produced the movie “The Hunt” that shows leftists killing conservatives for fun?  Will these companies have a double standard? \\n\\nMedia Matters reports that it has recently influenced several companies to stop advertising during Tucker Carlson Tonight.  The Media Matters article reports in part:  “This week, Long John Silver’s said it will no longer advertise on Fox News as a whole, and Nestlé, HelloFresh and Stein Mart confirmed that they are no longer running ads on Carlson’s show.”  Additionally, Huffington Post is a driving force behind the attack on Tucker Carlson.  Here is one  Twitter report showing HuffPost\\'s involvement.  NEW: AstraZeneca confirms to HuffPost that they \"are no longer advertising on the Tucker Carlson show and we will not be advertising on this program in the future.\"\\n\\nTucker Carlson has brought bold, fact based news perspectives to millions of Americans that no other cable news host has produced. Tucker Carlson Tonight:\\n\\n•    Diligently reported on Antifa’s violence towards conservatives and suppression of conservatives’ free speech and free assembly.  On the other hand, The NY Post reports:  CNN’s Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon have defended antifa on-air. Chuck Todd (NBC) invited antifa ideologue Mark Bray on “Meet the Press” to explain why antifa’s political violence is “ethical.”\\n\\n•    Repeatedly exposed Google’s censorship of Christians and conservatives.\\n\\n•    Exposed MSNBC’s fake white supremacist labeling of President Trump including MSNBC Contributor Frank Figliuzzi who alleged the president delivered a hidden Nazi message.\\n\\n•    Reported on NBC Universal Pictures’ recently produced movie \"The Hunt\" that depicts privileged leftist vacationers hunting \"deplorables\" (conservatives) for sport.  NBC Universal has cancelled the September 27, 2019 release date.  HOWEVER, NBC Universal Pictures reports:  “We stand by our filmmakers and will continue to distribute films in partnership with bold and visionary creators, like those associated with this satirical social thriller, but we understand that now is not the right time to release this film.”  Comcast owns NBC Universal.\\n\\nCarlson bravely challenges leftist hatred and exposes the dangers that contrived and vitriolic leftist news poses to American liberties and public safety.  The word \"bravely\" is used here because his personal home and family have been threatened.\\n\\nMedia Matters claims to have influenced numerous companies to stop advertising at Tucker Carlson Tonight. \\n\\nSo are the companies that pulled advertising from Tucker Carlson Tonight also going to STOP ADVERTISING on:\\n\\n•    Comcast Cable, NBC and its other affiliates after NBC Universal Pictures produced the movie “The Hunt” that shows leftists killing conservatives?   A recent NBC Universal Pictures statement implies it will release the film at “the right time.”\\n\\n•    CNN and MSNBC for defending and championing Antifa’s violence toward conservatives and their freedom of speech and assembly?\\n\\nIn light of these and other over the top leftist propaganda, advertisers need to show fairness toward conservative programming.  These advertisers need to be encouraged not to allow leftist vitriol to dissuade them from advertising on conservative programming.\\n\\nHere are some of the more substantial advertisers that Media Matters claims to have stopped advertising on Tucker Carlson Tonight since the beginning of the year:  HelloFresh, Nestle USA, Stein Mart, Long John Silver\\'s, AbbVie Inc, Ancestry, AstraZeneca, Bayer Healthcare, Bowflex (owned by Nautilus), Careerbuild.com, Farmers Insurance, Home Chef (Owned by Kroger), HOP (Owned by Dine Brands Global), Jaguar Land Rover, Just for Men (Owned by Combe Inc.), Pacific Life, Purple mattress, Red Lobster (Owned by Golden Gate Capital), Robitussin (Owned by Pfizer), Saatva Mattress, Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, TD Ameritrade and Zenni Optical.\\n\\nFlorida Family Association has prepared an email for you to send to challenge the companies that have stopped advertising with Tucker Carlson to return to his show. \\n\\nPlease cut and paste this link in to your browser and reply from the Florida Foundation Page that pops up. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwDqfLFXfWbCNLJKXWrNdgTdpTj\\n\\nBy the way Steinmart operates a store in Wilmington. You may want to contact them and let them know you will stop doing business with them. 910-772-1533. Farmers Insurance is a major carrier in this area. 910-343-9900.',\n",

       "  {'ad_creative_body': 'From the brilliant Isaura Jiménez Guerra:\\n\\n“Yesterday ICE carried out one of the largest immigration raids this country has seen. The fact that our government has the capacity to continue destabilizing communities and tearing families apart proves that our government has never stopped refining the capitalist, settler colonial, White supremacist strategies that were used in order to found this country.\\n\\nCapitalism rules everything around us.\\n\\nThere are accounts of the ways in which the U.S. cavalry massacred Indigenous people of all ages, not pausing until it was done in order to steal and colonize the land we now call “America”. Andrew Jackson argued that Native Americans did not properly know how to cultivate the value of their land. Forced relocation was another way that the U.S. government stole land, literally marching tribes like the Cherokee and the Ponca off their ancestral homelands in order to take it for themselves as people of all ages died in those death marches.\\n\\nSettler colonialists kidnapped people from Africa, separating families by selling the children and family members of enslaved people to further disempower and isolate. The codification of race through slavery was one way that the ruling class sought to protect their wealth and sow divisions. These things are part of a longer continuum of genocide rooted in capitalistic greed.\\n\\nAnyone surprised to learn that Hitler studied the U.S.’s policy of Native extermination and reservations in order to develop his own methods shouldn’t be. Anyone surprised that U.S. companies worked closely with Hitler’s regime, that IBM made special materials just so that they could be used in the concentration camps in order to aid in the categorization and mass murder of people during the holocaust, shouldn’t be. This history of sharing strategies and tools continues today as Palantir provides ICE with the tech it needs and Elbit Systems profit from providing their tech for border “security” in Palestine and the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nCapitalism ruins everything around us.\\n\\nIn one of the largest immigration raids this country has seen, ICE targeted the Koch Foods poultry plant in Morton, Mississippi. This factory was not just targeted because of its employment of undocumented people but because workers there have been organizing to gain better working conditions and put an end to abusive practices. Workers fought hard while their case was in litigation for 9 years before being settled last year. This is an example of how ICE is state sanctioned violence meant to destabilize and keep people afraid.\\n\\nLast weekend the shooting in El Paso reminded me of the fact that his lack of humanity and ability to target Latinx people was a result of a long history of dehumanization that is at the core of this country. The family separations we’re seeing at the border and as seen yesterday as almost 700 people were arrested while their children were at school; are not new. The deaths of children in detention centers are not new. The use of armed forces to keep people in line and reestablish control while continuing to make a profit, is not new. The use of corporate technology to facilitate the identification and harm of people, is not new.\\n\\nToday Jewish folks, immigrants, and allies protested outside of Seattle’s immigration court, while #NeverAgainSeattle shut down the downtown ICE office disrupting their daily operations and to call for the closure of all detention centers. This includes the NW Detention Center in Tacoma which is owned by GEO group, one of the most profitable corporations making money off of the imprisonment of people in this country. History isn’t repeating itself, rather the ruling class has figured out how to continue dividing and conquering for the sake of profit.\\n\\nThink about who you support (Patty Murray accepted money from GEO group last year), where you put your money (Bank of America continues to provide billions in credit to private prison corporations), why you might think this issue isn’t personally connected to you. Never again is now.”',\n",

It didn’t start with Charlottesville,\\n\\n whose residents grieve again this weekend on the second anniversary of the white supremacist invasion of that once peaceful college town.    \\n\\nIt started 400 years ago when the first African slaves were shipped to Jamestown, VA.\\n\\nIts latest revival began before the invasion of Charlottesville. Months before the invasion,  probes by the white supremacists began to prompt police to use tear gas on its own residents.\\n\\n\"I remember it like it was yesterday,\" the closest friend of victim Heather Heyer told me. Lindsey Reisser and her boyfriend Carl Thomas had gone out of town to a concert that weekend. Her phone kept vibrating. She didn\\'t take the call until the music stopped and a mutual friend told her that Heather was run over and lay in the street, stone cold dead. \\n\\nOn hearing the news, Lindsey collapsed on the concert\\'s stone floor. \\n\\n\"What am I doing up here when my city\\'s on fire,\" Carl Thomas moaned.  Lindsey’s African-American boyfriend broke down when he got back to work as a hotel room service delivery man. Carl told me that that day, \"When Trump says, \\'We\\'re going to make America great again,\\' I hear he\\'s going to make America white again. In that America, my grandfather was beaten in the streets. Charlottesville is my town. I was born here. They can\\'t hijack our city.\" \\n\\nToday, I was among many journalists to sign on to a phone conference hosted by a coalition of Charlottesville activists. They are demanding that Twitter shut down hate speech and white supremacists. #ChangeTheTerms is their demand.  But how?\\n\\n\"This weekend marks the second anniversary of the \\'Unite the Right Rally\\' in Charlottesville,” began  Jessica Gonzalez, co-founder of a coalition of 55 human, civil, and digital rights groups led by people of color, women, LGBTQ, white, black and brown activists. “Since then, our country has experienced white supremacy and violence in El Paso, Dayton, Pittsburgh, and well beyond. Twitter must acknowledge its role as a midwife for white nationalism.”\\n\\nThe coalition demands that Twitter ban white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and the violent extremists who organized the invasion of Charlottesville and are using their platform to energize the mounting race war. Twitter has hidden behind the false bromide that public conversations prevent hatred. \\n\\nThe Charlottesville founder of Black Lives Matter, Don Gathers, hcacaad a strong response to a question from a journalist asking, “Is there a ban being called for on Donald Trump’s Twitter messages, many of which would qualify as hate speech?”\\n\\nLisa Woolfork, associate professor at University of Virginia, responded: “Change the Term has 55 members in the group; some are calling for that, but as a group we are not explicitly calling for that. “\\n\\nJessica Gonzalez added: “It’s notable that Facebook has banned white supremacists. Twitter has not.  I have seen Facebook purge many white supremacists off its site. Is it a perfect system? No.  Enforcement needs to be improved.”',\n",

       "  {'ad_creative_body': 'Is there any doubt now about the deadly consequences of Trump\\'s election? \\n\\nThere is a direct line between this weekend\\'s mass shootings in Gilroy and El Paso and the President\\'s stoking of racist hatred against left-wing Congresswomen of color and Latinx immigrants, his refusal to condemn neo-Nazis at Charlottesville, his cries of \"send them back,\" \"infestation\" and \"invasion.\" Trumpism draws on a long history of racism, nationalism, and xenophobia in U.S. politics to inspire what are essentially modern day lynchings. And policy accompanies the weaponry: concentration camps on the border, the acceleration of voter suppression, the \"Muslim ban\" and more. As others have pointed out, white supremacist terror and white supremacist policy go together, hand in glove. And they are the battering ram for pushing through Trumpism\\'s full reactionary package: roll back women\\'s and LGBTQ rights, decimate the labor movement, deny climate change, expand the military budget and threaten war against Iran.\\n\\nThe bottom line: The virulence and intensity of this weekend\\'s racial violence, ginned up from the White House, is a five-alarm emergency for the country and the left.\\n\\nDebating the strategy and tactics for the struggle against Trumpism, and the role of socialists and the left within that struggle, have been at the center of radical attention and Organizing Upgrade\\'s work over the past two years. Those debates - over the best ways to combine class politics with racial justice, internationalist, and feminist commitments, the possibilities and limitations for building power utilizing electoral politics, the balance of forces within and beyond the Democratic Party, the significance of increasing militancy among teachers, environmental activists, and others - will continue. The struggle against Trumpism will last longer than any electoral cycle. But we are clear that the 2020 elections, which are already underway, are a pivotal contest in the course of our struggle. Defeating the political bloc that is driven by white nationalism and has captured the Republican Party is our immediate responsibility as left organizers committed to the defense of the oppressed, the exploited, and the democratic space required to organize a movement large, united and powerful enough to contend for power and change the world. More than ever, we hold onto our belief that we can organize to win, if we stay focused on the scale and scope necessary to build real power. Let\\'s do this thing.\\n\\nIn solidarity,\\n\\nThe Organizing Upgrade Editorial Collective:\\nCalvin Cheung-Miaw, Claire Tran, Harmony Goldberg, Jacob Swenson-Lengyel, Julie Chinitz, Kim Diehl, Max Elbaum, Rishi Awatramani, Stina Janssen',\n",

This year is the 7th anniversary of this tragedy. \\nSikhism, the 5th largest religion in the world, has originated from India. Since 9/11, Sikhs have often been made the target of hate and violence in America due to ignorance about our outer identity of turban and beard. People think that Sikhs belong to the Middle East, Isis or that they are part of anti-American groups.\\n\\nSikhism preaches racial & gender equality, respect for all religions and that one should share one's blessings with the less fortunate and underprivileged in society. Sikhs have been part of America for the last 100 years and yet most Americans have no clue about the religion and its practices in which the males and some females wear turban as a symbol of equality and royalty. It stands for justice and love for all!\\n\\nAmerica lowered its flags in honor of these victims. Millions of Americans poured love and support to the Sikhs for which the community will always remain grateful.\\n\\nWe also believe that America's strength is due to its diversity and no one person or community should be made the target of hate or violence.\\nThe six victims killed included one woman: Paramjit Kaur, 41; and five men: Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, the founder of the gurdwara; Prakash Singh, 39, a Granthi; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; and Suveg Singh Khattra, 84. All of the male victims wore turbans as part of their Sikh faith.\\nਅਮਰੀਕਾ ਵਿਸਕਾਨਸਿਨ ਗੁਰਦੁਆਰੇ ਤੇ ਇੱਕ ਗੋਰੇ ਨੇ 2012 ਚ ਅਟੈਕ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਿਸ ਵਿੱਚ ੬ ਸਿੱਖ ਮਾਰੇ ਗਏ ਸੀ। ਆਮ ਅਮਰੀਕਨਾਂ ਨੇ ਅਤੇ ਪੈ੍ਜੀਡੈਂਟ ਓਬਾਮਾ ਨੇ ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਸਟੈਂਡ ਲਿਆ। ਵਾਈਟ ਹਾਊਸ ਤੇ ਅਮਰੀਕਾ ਦਾ ਝੰਡਾ ਥੱਲੇ ਕੀਤਾ ਗਿਆ।\\n#Sikhs #SikhsInAmerica #SikhAmericans #Hatecrimes #Sikhism #5thLargestReligion\\n\\n#DonLemon #OakCreek #WhiteSupramacist #WhiteSupremacy #Hate Don Lemon CNN See Less\",\n",

Another similar sounding manifesto, another Frankenstein document remixing the most atrocious genocidal rhetoric pulled from the darkest corners of the internet, alt-right \\'white genocide\\' fear mongering, and a conservative party in the United States that has traded dog-whistle racism for a bull-horn and brazen calls that radicalize and enduce terrorist violence.\\n\\nHow did we get here? Like many of the issues I talk about, we must recognize there is a deep historical analysis we must turn to understand the evil violence that is occurring around us. White supremacist terrorism has escalated and become emboldened by Trump, but it is also, if I may be a cynical realist, as American as apple pie. The triplet forces of capitalism, patriarchy, and colonialism inform the events we are witnessing today. Mostly young white men, alienated by the cultural decay of late stage capitalism and social mores that reinforce the notion that they should be at the top of the social hierarchy, create a cultural powder keg that leads to literal, physical death and mayhem.\\n\\nThere is no easy \"policy fix\" for this. While robust education programs for white working people to expose them to analysis like that in this video would do much to fight back against white supremacist brainwashing, the best answer is more intimate. \\n\\nTalk to the young white men in your lives (especially and particularly white people). Have the tough conversations. Do everything you possibly can to make sure they do not begin treading down a bleak, hateful path.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/XdhIYWb3XVU',\n",

El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said “We have a manifesto from this individual that indicates a potential nexus to a hate crime, we have to validate for certain that this was a manifesto from this individual we arrested.” \\n\\nThe manifesto, a document appearing on the online message board 8chan before the shooting rampage, spoke about an “invasion” of Latino immigrants and noted that the writer agreed with the shooter who killed scores of Islamic worshipers in March at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. \\n\\nStatement from Beto O’Rourke: \"We\\'ve had a rise in hate crimes every single one of the last three years, during an administration where you have a president who\\'s called Mexicans rapists and criminals. Though Mexican immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than those born here in the country, he has tried to make us afraid of them, to some real effect and consequence, attempting to ban all Muslims from this country. The day he signed that executive order the mosque in Victoria, Texas, was burned to the ground. Those chants that we heard in Greenville, North Carolina, \\'send her back,\\' talking about our fellow American citizens, duly elected to represent their constituents in the congress who happen to be women of color. He is a racist and he stokes racism in this country, and it does not just offend our sensibilities. It fundamentally changes the character of this country and it leads to violence.\"\\n\\nThis shooting was by a national white supremacist, and is considered a hate crime and domestic terrorism.

       "  {'ad_creative_body': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ORDERS DEATH PENALTY RESTORED\\n\"Who says the death penalty is not a deterrent?\"  Donald Trump, 2013.\\nThough a number of states have invoked the death penalty during the intervening years, the Government has not executed a federal prisoner since March, 2003. Five men will now be scheduled to die. To express your view, NotWe.org has set-up links to learn how best to reach elected officials CongressionalBest.com & SenatorialBest.com.\\n\\nPresumably attempting to temper justice with mercy, while reinstating the ultimate penalty Attorney General Barr also directed that a single injection replace the three-drug cocktail in general use today. Pentobarbital, a gentle barbiturate long employed by veterinarians.to put animals \\'to sleep,\\' is frequently used in states and countries that permit assisted suicides. The pain from the paralytic first of three lethal injections in current use, Midazolam,  is reportedly so excruciating that prisoners have requested death by a firing squad instead. The execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma in 2014  reportedly took 43 minutes while Lockett ‘thrashed on the gurney, writhing and groaning’. \\n\\nToday, most states administer lethal injections, however electric chairs and firing squads still exist under some state\\'s laws. 35 convicts were executed in 2018 and 2019, all but two by lethal injection. Though 55% of Americans favor the death penalty, a 2018 Gallup poll revealed that only 49 percent agree that it is imposed fairly. \\n\\nAdvocates decry: the crimes committed by these federal prisoners who are now awaiting death are heinous -- the criminals deserve to die. Criminals facing federal execution include Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist convicted of murdering a family of three, including an eight-year-old girl. Another is Lezmond Mitchell, who was found guilty of stabbing a 63-year-old woman and forcing her granddaughter to sit beside her lifeless body until, eventually, he slit her throat.\\n\\nOpponents argue, often citing the Washington state Supreme Court ruling that the death penalty is unconstitutional because it has been applied unequally among different races. They add that most of the world\\'s nations have abolished the death penalty altogether. Among 195 U N member or observer states, only 28% still observe capital punishment in both law and practice. Detractors contend that such punishments as isolation can be as strong, or even stronger, deterrents than death. Finally, they protest that by legalizing murder, whatever the reason, the government lowers itself to the level of the criminals it executes.\\n\\nPlease add your comments to this post, whether pro or con. None will be edited, and next week we will pass all along to presidential candidates\\' Facebook groups \\n\\nPhoto collage by NotWe.org',\n",

       "  {'ad_creative_body': 'Eleanor Holmes Norton was born on June 13, 1937 in Washington, D.C. to parents Coleman and Vela Holmes.  Both her parents were government employees.  Growing up in a well educated and politically conscious household caused Eleanor Holmes to be very aware of the surrounding struggles for African Americans.  At the age of 12, she recalled watching protests against a Washington, D.C. department store which allowed black shoppers but refused them entry into its bathrooms.\\n\\nIn 1955, Eleanor entered Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio where she became heavily involved with civil rights work.  While in college she headed the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter and became a local activist working to desegregate public facilities in Ohio.  The emerging civil rights movement influenced her decision to enter Yale University in 1960 with the intention of becoming a civil rights lawyer.  In 1963 Holmes worked in Mississippi for the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).  She graduated from Yale in 1963 with a Master’s in American Studies and a law degree in 1964.\\n\\nEleanor Holmes moved to Philadelphia in 1964 to work as a law clerk for Federal Judge A. Leon Higginbotham.  The following year she married Edward Norton and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar as an attorney.  From 1965 to 1970 she worked for the New York office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  In 1968 Norton was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court where in her first case she successfully defended the National States Rights Party, a white supremacist group that was denied a permit to hold a political rally in Maryland.  Between 1970 and 1977, Eleanor Holmes Norton headed New York City’s Human Rights Commission.  In 1973 Norton organized African American women from across the nation into the National Black Feminist Organization... #blackfacts #blackfacts365 http://blackfacts.com/f/6025',\n",

Whether in bulletproof vests, police badges, MAGA hats, or in khakis, fascists thrive when we look the other way.\\n\\nDC is not new to this. We remember the days before Unite the Right when Nazis brandished guns and Confederate flags in Southeast DC. When Richard Collins III was murdered at the hands of a local alt-right extremist. Where MPD resists implementing the NEAR act, for community accountability of police.\\n\\nAnd in the suburbs, we see white nationalist sheriffs working through 287(g) contracts to kidnap, imprison, and deport migrants.\\n\\nRight here DC, we saw the Clark brothers planning similar attacks to the Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue massacre.\\n\\nIf we want to live in a world where black and brown people are not locked in cages, or killed by right-wing police; where public safety is community lead. Where people from Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador are more free to move across borders than dirty fossil fuel corporations. Wherever state violence grows, we must support communities of resistance.\\n\\nNot only will we deny the alt-right a platform, but we will also build the capacity to undermine the border, prison system, and welcome the free movement of people. Our collective vision for a world based on solidarity, support, and autonomy begins with our collective resistance now.\\n\\nTogether we can stop the alt-right and watch Trump’s white supremacist fantasies crumble once and for all.\\n\\n###\\n\\nIn DC\\n\\nCome out and support the coming #AlloutDC mobilization. Let us show why thousands of people greeted less than 20 scared nazis last year for Unite The Right 2. There are real alternatives in our community to xenophobia and white supremacy. Neighbors support neighbors at several Really Really Free Markets/free stores, communities bailing out black mothers, and communities welcoming newcomers. Our vision for a more free society where we share power and support each other is in direct conflict with the Proud Boys and fascists coming to DC.\\n\\nIt should be met with communities willing to defend the most marginalized.\\n\\nOutside of DC\\n\\nHold a solidarity demonstration against organized hate and white supremacy. Mobilize against a new jail, 287g contacts, or funding line of private prisons/ICE detention centers such as Wells Fargo, Suntrust, or Bank of America. Organize a benefit to bail out black mothers, mutual aid disaster relief, resistance on the borderlands, or show the values of mutual aid and solidarity. Occupy ICE headquarters or police stations.\\n\\nEach time a fascist shows up in one of our community lets show that community-led resistance and solidarity is a real alternative to authoritarianism, hate, and xenophobia.\\n\\nwww.alloutdc.org\\n\\nSigned,\\n\\nAll Out DC\\nBlock The Wall Network\\nFrederick Socialists\\nMarch For Racial Justice \\nOccupy Wall St\\nOne People’s Project\\nRising Tide North America,\\nRevolutionary Education and Defense\\nSanctuary DMV \\nSmash Racism DC\\nIt’s Going Down\",\n",

       "  {'ad_creative_body': 'Professor Nelson asserts :As a Critical Race Theorist, I dare not argue that racism in the United States will meet its end, for racism is a consistent and persistent nuisance for Black Americans. I do, however, argue that Black people should take concerted and purposeful efforts to be both proactive and reactive both overtly and covertly to oppressive policies and practices, especially in educational systems. The integration agenda has not produced dramatic gains for Black peoples in the United States; thus, the time has come to consider other efforts - ones that both complement and/or replace the integration agenda - in the pursuit of educational equity. Perhaps, as Dumas instructs, we must no longer wait for superman since he is likely to come with another dose of antiblackness in education policy. The return to segregation, especially via enrollment in special education programs, might actually provide racial and ethnic minorities a federally protected right to education. Of course, the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Brown v. Board of Education forbids the segregation of public schools on the account of students\\' races, but the Supreme Court has done very little to restrict the disproportionate enrollment of Black students in special education programs, which suggests that the federal courts do not see overrepresentation of Black students in special education programs as inherently violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Similarly, even the earliest forms of Critical Race Theory acknowledged a tenet of Black nationalism and separatism suggesting that Black people have long sought independence from an educational system built on white supremacist ideologies and practices. Thus, the Supreme Court\\'s hollowing of Brown and the need for Black peoples\\' immediate and uncontested right to educational equity cannot and should not fall merely because Black peoples and White people are not learning in the same classroom or school building.\"',\n",

       "  {'ad_creative_body': 'You want to check out this argument against \"centrism\" or \"incrementalism.\" I call it setting up the ball for Republicans to knock the ball out of the park in there want to take the country back to the year 1850.  Aren\\'t we fighting the fight for a woman to have control over her own body again? I understand that there are differing viewpoints on that even here, but who wants to defend a government full of \"boomers\" that pretend science doesn\\'t exist to make that decision? Or States Rights? We read here; we know that is just a tired dog-whistle for people trying to mask an evil use of the state to enforce their will on people long after the country sees the evil. It’s old and unoriginal.  Here is AOC. arguing that it is time to stop giving our reasonable values away to hateful, racist, sexist, bigoted dinosaurs. I\\'m with AOC, people who are sitting at home are there because they know we are just setting up for Trump 2, which will be worse because the sequel will get to learn from the present manifestation of the United States unwillingness to repent from its original sin. Look at the success of this one. A whole generation of movies, media, and the election of Barack Obama because he was the best candidate saying we will not compromise with hate and that is what makes us great. Now the tone is, “let’s see if we can meet hate in the middle somewhere. We don’t want to be divisive.” Hatred is divisive by nature, separating yourself from it, naming it, and declaring open war against it is unity for the righteous. Anything else is compromising values that ought not even be under consideration for compromise. We don’t vote for demographic changes in this country because we aren’t bigots that vote on whether a person must be white, black, brown, or etc. to live. That is what Nazis do and part of being a citizen of the United States is not being a Nazi. That was common sense and it ought return to being common sense.\\n \\nThe only compromise there can be with willful and intentional evil is evil. It used to be unarguable that hating another person because they were born a bit different from you was evil. Magically, that wisdom has been forgotten, except when it can be cynically weaponized by the very same party that has been soft selling bigotry as long as I’ve been alive. Everyone knows that is true, even the people that come lie about it. So, they come up with “post-truth.” If you shot a person, they are shot. If a white supremacist goes grabbing his gun and write a manifesto telling you the president is setting the right tone for him to hear what he wants to hear, and he wants to hear that he should murder for the “White Race” because he thinks that “their” women might choose chocolate milk as part of a Jewish conspiracy everyone he kills is dead. There is no debate that is going to bring our Jewish brothers and sisters back. There isn’t a bit of sophistry that will allow us to laugh with our lost Muslim brothers and sisters. No politician trolling on the floor of the house is going to bring back the smiling faces of the descendants of slaves that have now become regular victims of a problem that is obvious and undeniable.  Acting as if the same jurors’ parents didn’t vote the same way in the face of equally obvious atrocities is a denial of history as the survivors of that history stand witness. The shame of families seperated for fleeing violence and seeking shelter in the United States to be treated worse than prisoners will not wash off when we send the politicians that were elected on their backs to public disgrace, but that is where they must go if the flag is to be anything other than a byword. Evil and its compromises. \\n\\nAs a country, a population has taught its children to hate In service to a myth we didn’t need and  to maintain policies that are quickly taking us right back to the time of the United States most long-standing sin. Although one of the two major political parties has found a great deal of success over the years through keeping those feelings and the tragedies that underlie those feelings at the four front, what it has cost them is evident as people calling themselves followers of Christ put a mentally unstable womanizer in the place of Jesus. Every Christian knows idolatry is the heart of all sin, yet you engage in it openly and just yell that you are not. The smarter ones will even bear false witness towards the people that point out this hypocrisy. But back to compromise. Take a look at the state of Trump and his party, then remind yourself that it started with a compromise with willful and intentional evil. Who are these people that are in the middle on this? I think we need to bet that they might be double agents or walk a different way so as not to get their ends. \\nI’m tired of children killing people because we can put warning labels on rap songs and video games, but not hate speech. This is a capitalist economy, as everyone keeps yelling as loud as they can, if it is being done, then it is being done for money. Let us try to go forward with vision as uncompromising as the leaders that drug this country into the mud, for the things we all want the future of our children to be. At least if you believe that good can overcome evil. I do. And evil made some steps toward its vision, now let’s try good. Once, the country was coming out of a dark time and a generation passed the torch to the children hoping that they could fix all the pain and destruction. The “Boomers” got us a little ways. Now it’s time for the “Boomers” to do the same. Next, it will be time for another generation to do the same. It will only be that way if the “Boomers” lend their wisdom but pass the torch.',\n",
