As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions.

Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength.

We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know. Your kindness and compassion matter. Us encouraging others to follow in your path matters, too: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nThanks once more.\",\n",

Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know. Your kindness and compassion matter. Us encouraging others to follow in your path matters, too: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nThanks once more.\",\n",

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel.

Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well.

It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them.

I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions.

Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them.

I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well.

It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of.

The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in.

Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of.

The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where?

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where?

Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well.

It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know.

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. \\n\\nYes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. \\n\\nPlus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. \\n\\nAs I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. \\n\\nHistory always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.\\n\\nSo much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know. Your kindness and compassion matter. Us encouraging others to follow in your path matters, too: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nThanks once more.\",\n",

And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them.

It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know.

Our message of: \\n\\nCooking is\\n\\nWhat happens when\\n\\nYou care about people \\n\\nwould be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. \\n\\nTo celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.\\n\\nTo get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. \\n\\nOur Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nOf course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.\\n\\nOnline at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. \\n\\nThrough Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s\\n\\nAnd a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.\\n\\nAnd let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. \\n\\nThat those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.\\n\\nProgress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. \\n\\nAt the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. \\n\\nThere really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.\\n\\nThanks for absolutely everything,\\n\\nBill\\n\\nbill@penzeys.com \\n\\nAnd please sign up for our voice of Cooking email list and encourage/share signing up with those you know. Your kindness and compassion matter. Us encouraging others to follow in your path matters, too: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html\\n\\nThanks once more.\",\n",

The first matter Paul brings up: prayer. Prayer is extremely important for this to be the very first matter brought up.\\n\\nPaul encourages the Church to pray for kings and others in high authority so that they, along with the Church and the others in the land, might lead to peaceful, quiet, godly, and dignified lives. Praying for our national leaders has become a lost priority for the church today, especially for our national leaders. We sometimes either selectively choose to only pray for those national leaders in Government who represent our favorite political party and despise the other, or we just don’t pray at all because we rather debate and embrace divisiveness spit out from either political party and news outlets that feed our cravings. \\n\\nHowever, this is the opposite of what Paul instructs us to do. We MUST pray for the President, Congress, and Senators because prayer is an instrument God graciously will use to compel national leaders in the United States to lead peaceful, quiet, godly, and dignified lives. And we all know this is a revival the United States deeply needs through Jesus Christ.\\n\\nWe must choose to pray for national leaders before gossiping about them as terrible leaders. Yes, to a degree this is very true, but our job in the Church is to pray our national leaders to end up having a heart change. This is hard to say and practice, but it's needed. Imagine if we--the Church did this, together? It's possible. It's needed.\\n\\nRemember, we beat to a different drum. We pray for those leaders of the Democratic party who are okay with abortion and those leaders of the Republican Party who are racist/xenophobic toward Immigrants and Migrants. Let's pray and spend time with God.”\\n\\n- Rondell Treviño, Founder/Director\",\n",
