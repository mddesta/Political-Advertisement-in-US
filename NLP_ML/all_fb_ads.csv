All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free                                          concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you                                          care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility                                          away from artists, but it hasn't changed you...                                          We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others                                          have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored                                          and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you.                                           Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many                                          stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent                                          violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that                                          someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You                                          and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be                                          successful, still be self-made...                                          Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we                                          know and love, Chicago.                                          Sincerely,                                          Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt                                          Lake View High School Students                                          Chicago, Illinois""                                           It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young                                           people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who                                          cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.                                           It should work.                                          As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget                                          who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love.                                          That's cool that this love goes back and forth!                                          We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some                                           people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day                                          different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.                                          #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness                                          #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america                                          #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music                                          #hiphop #rap                 Ad Landing Page https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence                      Ad Targeting Location - Living In: United States                                          Age: 18 - 65+                                          Placements: News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile                                          devices                                          People Who Match: Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful,                                           Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!

Two months                                    before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two                                    sons.                                    Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of                                    his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in                                    Indianapolis at the age of 26.                                    Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what                                    authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-                                    duty firefighter.                                    The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest                                    Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.                                    Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old                                    sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her                                    off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of                                    their cars.                                    At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a                                    gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.                                    She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started                                    shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his                                    gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal                                    legally owned the gun and did not fire it.                                    Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began                                    shooting him.                                    ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley.                                    Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-                                    old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.
