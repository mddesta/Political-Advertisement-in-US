            <h3>Machine Learning</h3> <br><br>
            <p>
                With the upcoming election in mind, ourteam wanted to build a Machine Learning tool that would allow us
                to differentiate between organic ads and Russian Ads. We used the Facebook API data and the IRA data to
                train the program.
            </p>
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='Chart_adlength.png')}}" Style="height:500px"><br>
            <p>
                This chart shows that in general, the real Facebook ads were longer (had more words in each ad). This
                makes it easier for the machine learning model to identify the real ads from the fake ones presented by
                the Internet Research Agency (otherwise known as the “Russian troll farm”).
            </p><br>
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='Chart_punctuation.png')}}" Style="height:500px"><br>
            <p>
                This chart shows what percentage of each ad was made up of any of the following punctuation marks:
                !“#$%&\‘()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, there is almost no punctuation used in the ads created by the IRA. This could
                perhaps represent a deficiency in the data set, as the data was compiled into PDF files which were
                then parsed to create one directory of all of the points of information on each PDF (ad text,
                creation date, impressions, etc). There could also be improved reporting of the text of Facebook
                ads, as the ads from this dataset were created in 2015-2017, whereas the ads pulled through the
                Facebook API only go back through 2018.
            </p><br>
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='Confusion_matrix.png')}}" Style="height:500px"><br>
            <p>
                The confusion matrix visually represents the success of our model at distinguishing ‘fake’ (IRA-created)
                Facebook ads from real Facebook ads that were accessed through their API. The accuracy of our model was
                99.8%, which means that it was able to successfully distinguish between real or fake ads in 99.8% of the
                test data fed into the model. There were initially over 3400 ads used from the IRA, and over 4400 which
                were pulled through the Facebook API. The majority were used to train the machine learning model on the
                difference between the two, and when tested, the model correctly labeled 873 out of 876 IRA ads and 702
                out of 702 ads collected through the API.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                With more time, our team would like to integrate this to our website and allow users to enter ads and
                find out whether they were IRA or organic ads.
