"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‚ÄòDANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC‚Äô AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to ‚Äústop using dangerous and false‚Äù rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  ‚ÄúLaw enforcement is under assault in this country,‚Äù wrote the Herald‚Äôs editorial board. ‚ÄúSeveral ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.‚Äù

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ‚Äúmust stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,‚Äù against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren‚Äôs rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown‚Äôs case released during the Obama administration, ‚ÄúThe unarmed 18-year-old black man‚Äôs shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‚Äòself-defense‚Äô by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer‚Äôs testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,‚Äù the Herald wrote.

‚ÄúThe Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer‚Äô is ‚Äòappalling,‚Äô‚Äù the Herald noted.

The Herald‚Äôs accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren‚Äôs statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: ‚ÄúMSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.‚Äù

    MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered https://t.co/gRJZqDmGZ0

    ‚Äî Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with ‚Äúsomething that reflects our morality.‚Äù She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, ‚ÄúThis is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.‚Äù [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers ‚Äî the same ones Warren derides routinely ‚Äî apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

‚ÄúOn Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,‚Äù The Boston Herald editors wrote. ‚ÄúThose same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.‚Äù

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,‚Äù Warren said in August 2018. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.‚Äù

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"Anthony Scaramucci Reveals The Last Straw
William Southold | Opinion Columnist |The Southold Report
‚ÄúSpeaking fiction to power one story at a time.‚Äù
Veritas Per Ficta!

Donald Trump attacked Anthony Scaramucci (again) on Twitter this morning, just as I was finishing this story you are reading now. I had tracked Scaramucci down this weekend at Tate‚Äôs Bake Shop in Southampton. I had gotten the word that he was crazy for their in season, fresh picked raspberry scones, and why wouldn‚Äôt he be, I was chowing down on one when I saw him come through the door.

I gave him time to make his order and sit down before I approached him, and asked for a word. He took one look at his phone and shut it down before he looked up and said, ‚ÄúSure, have a seat. I know you.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know which surprised me more, the fact that he knew me, or the fact that he graciously allowed me to join him. It was early, and we were the only two seated on the far side, furthest from the counter.

‚ÄúI know you,‚Äù he repeated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you around D.C. Tell me your name again.‚Äù

I did, and he responded, ‚ÄúOh, yeah, the Fake News guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNone other.""

‚ÄúHey, you know I was once a Fake HouseGuest on Celebrity Big Brother 2.‚Äù

‚ÄúCelebrity Big Brother . . .?‚Äù

‚ÄúA show I was on once. It was a blast. You didn‚Äôt see it. That‚Äôs OK. So what can I do for you Mr. Fake News Guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, trying to get right to it, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been all over the news lately, encouraging people . . .‚Äù

‚ÄúTo think for themselves‚Äù he cut me off. ‚ÄúWe are in a terrible fix, our country of ours, and we need to do something about it. Quickly. Bigly, as my old but briefest of bosses might have said it.‚Äù

He sounded hopped up on coffee, but there was no food or drink in front of him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard you‚Äôre working with Bill Kristol, to come up with a challenger to your once brief boss,‚Äù I said.

Just then the waitress brought his order over. Yep, raspberry scone. Nailed it!

‚ÄúThank you, Margaret. Looks great,‚Äù he told her.

‚ÄúAlways is,‚Äù she said, and turned and left.

‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs always important to thank your service people, by name. By name,‚Äù he repeated. They don‚Äôt always stay as waitresses, or whatever. People need recognition! They need to know when they are doing their job well.  That's how you get better service.  Now, what were we talking about? I gotta tell ya, I come in here to work, so . . .‚Äù hands extended, palms up, phone at the ready, with a little shrug.

I took it as intended, to bring our brief conversation to an end.

‚ÄúSo any comment on Kristol?‚Äù I asked him, making ready to get up.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs gotta be done, I can tell you that, and Kristol‚Äôs a man who can pull it all together.

He paused a moment, in thought. ‚ÄúYou know, everybody thought I got fired because of my profanity laced tirade. The truth is, I wanted out. Do you know what was the last thing Trump asked me to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean before you . . . left as Communication Director?

‚ÄúYeah. The big guy could tell things were goin‚Äô south with his Black Outreach‚Äù he liked to call it. He calls me into the Oval, and shows me this gold plated statue he had made. Says right on it, World‚Äôs Least Racist Person EVER!.

‚ÄúHe had a statue of himself, World‚Äôs Least Racist . . . ‚Äú

‚ÄúYeah, you got it. He told me I had to find a Black celebrity, he wanted Iron Mike, or Dennis Rodman, or Kanye, that‚Äôs who he really wanted. He told me to find one of them, and tell them to present him with this statue. Like it was their idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a little . . . bold.‚Äù

‚ÄúYa think? It‚Äôs bull goose looney! I said Boss, he used to like me to call him Boss, I said you can‚Äôt ask someone else to lie for you. You gotta go at it straight. There must be plenty of celebs willing to come out for you over racism. And he says, no, this is the way. It‚Äôs gotta be big. We can do the whole thing in the Rose Garden, it‚Äôs gotta be the gold plated statue.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say, but it‚Äôs all a big lie you‚Äôre trying to pull off, you want someone to go on the record with your lie, and he says, Mooch, you know it‚Äôs my way or the highway around here. You get that much don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was his response?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Big Lie, the bigger the better. People need to stop putting up with it. I called him on it. He doesn‚Äôt like that one bit. Next thing I know, I got canned.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, can I quote you on this?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. Quote me all you want. People need to know this stuff. It‚Äôs time to pull the plug on this nut job.‚Äù

I left Mr. Scaramucci to his coffee and scone, and was working on this story when Trump unleashed his latest attack dog tweet on the Mooch. So, that‚Äôs the story at this hour. It‚Äôs bound to change, though. It‚Äôs about Trump.

"It's World Humanitarian Day AND #MemberMonday ‚Äî Clara Luper seemed like the obvious fit. 

During her 41 years as an award-winning Oklahoma educator, Luper taught history and made history. She grew up in Okfuskee County (near Hoffman) and went on to receive her Bachelor of Arts degree from Langston University and her master's degree from The University of Oklahoma. 

Luper is known as the mother of the civil rights movement. In 1958, she coordinated the first publicized sit-in in the nation at the Katz Drug Store lunch counter in Oklahoma City. Thanks to her persistence and patience, Katz desegregated the lunch counters in each of its 38 stores. 

""I knew I was right, because somewhere I read in the 14th Amendment that I was a citizen and I had rights, and I had the right to eat. Within that hamburger was the whole essence of democracy. If you could deny me the right to eat, you could deny me the right to live or work where I want."" ‚Äî Clara Luper

This month is also the 50th anniversary of the OKC Sanitation Strike, where more than 200 Black sanitation workers went on strike, citing poor working conditions, pay and racist treatment. Luper was instrumental in leading this movement.

"Having my mom Sherry and my brother Jake out for my campaign rally today was my absolute favorite part of the evening. 

Let me tell you a little about Sherry. She moved to California by herself when she was 17 and fudged her age to get a job, car, and apartment. 

She always tried to be involved in our lives even when she worked multiple jobs and had trouble with our dad. She planned a really fun Halloween party for our friends when I was in 4th grade that all my high school friends still talk about even though we're grown. She lead my brother‚Äôs cub scout troupe and took him to baseball practice, and came to girl scout camp. 

As we got older our house was the safe haven for endless streams of our friends. Some in crisis, some just came for the Motown parties and food. 

We were always taught to be kind and compassionate. I remember her pulling over on the highway to dump a person that used racist slurs in her car. We had foster kids and an extra set of bunk beds for whoever needed a place. 

When we got into middle school she started taking us to work at night. We cleaned offices, homes, and factories. Other nights we slung pizza in the back of a liquor store. I spent a lot of time on shop floors, farms, and in custodial closets. Respect for manual labor and working class people was central to my formation.

My mom always wanted to be a teacher or social worker, but never had the chance to finish college. 
So this is for her.",2019-08-18T02:53:38+0000,Emily Demorest for City Commission,0,99,1000,4999,1,Michigan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‚ÄòDANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC‚Äô AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to ‚Äústop using dangerous and false‚Äù rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  ‚ÄúLaw enforcement is under assault in this country,‚Äù wrote the Herald‚Äôs editorial board. ‚ÄúSeveral ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.‚Äù

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ‚Äúmust stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,‚Äù against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren‚Äôs rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown‚Äôs case released during the Obama administration, ‚ÄúThe unarmed 18-year-old black man‚Äôs shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‚Äòself-defense‚Äô by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer‚Äôs testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,‚Äù the Herald wrote.

‚ÄúThe Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer‚Äô is ‚Äòappalling,‚Äô‚Äù the Herald noted.

The Herald‚Äôs accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren‚Äôs statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: ‚ÄúMSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.‚Äù

    MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered https://t.co/gRJZqDmGZ0

    ‚Äî Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with ‚Äúsomething that reflects our morality.‚Äù She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, ‚ÄúThis is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.‚Äù [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers ‚Äî the same ones Warren derides routinely ‚Äî apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

‚ÄúOn Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,‚Äù The Boston Herald editors wrote. ‚ÄúThose same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.‚Äù

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,‚Äù Warren said in August 2018. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.‚Äù

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"I want to ask Christians a very serious question. I ask for your sincere prayer on this. Many Christians say they have no problem with immigrants as long as they come here legally. They cite Romans 13 to support this. They demand that immigrants ""respect our laws."" They say it's just that simple.

I have heard thousands of complaints about undocumented immigrants over the last several years. However, I have very rarely heard any public outcry over the business owners who knowingly hire them--an act which is often a much more serious illegal offense than simply being here without proper documents, as this article points out (see comments for article).

If you say that the business owners are just caught in a difficult circumstance where the market forces them to hire undocumented workers or go out of business... then perhaps it is also easy to believe that the people coming here without papers are also being forced to do so due the very same market forces.

This is what makes it so difficult to believe objections over undocumented immigrants are really about the law. Because if it is about the integrity--or even as some say, the sanctity of the law (in light of their interpretation of Romans 13)--then that judgment would be applied more consistently to all.  In fact, the native-born citizen business owners no doubt have a team of lawyers to make sure they know the law whereas an undocumented immigrant from another country would most likely not have those kinds of resources. But few decry the whole system that illegally exploits and benefits from the labor of undocumented immigrants... virtually all complaints are about the immigrants themselves.

People get offended when they are accused of being ""racist"" or having prejudices against another culture, language, race or ethnicity or just a general unwelcoming of ""outsiders"" or people who look or seem ""different"" (it wouldn't be a religious objection, because the immigrants from Central America are almost all Evangelical, Pentecostal or Catholic Christians--you would think the common religious tradition would form a bond between people but in this case not so much). I don't enjoy making those accusations, either, if for no other reason than it tends to interrupt the possibility for a discussion and puts people on the defensive. However, I hope you understand that inconsistencies like those pointed out above lead people wonder what the REAL reason is for the hard hardheartedness when it comes to immigrants. It really does not seem like the stated reason (the law) is the real reason.

Further, many immigrants (such as asylum seekers) are NOT even doing anything illegal but the negative outcry is the same. Many who are speaking out against immigrants do not even bother to hear directly from the immigrants themselves as to why they do what they do and the difficult circumstances they are in and the hard choices they have had to make. Quick, harsh judgments are made about them without a sincere, thoughtful, personal inquiry.

There are people so upset over immigration they want a wall almost 2,000 miles long to keep ""them"" out. Some are so upset they demand armed militia ""protect"" the border--a ridiculous idea but I mention it here to illustrate a point:  I don't hear any proposed ideas to discourage business owners or hold them accountable for their illegal practices. I don't see protests outside of the HQ of these businesses nor do I hear a desire for these business owners to be subjected to the same dehumanizing and abusive conditions which immigrants are subject to in our immigrant detention facilities (just for the record, I don't support that either, but I mention it to illustrate a point). Usually Christians don't see themselves as enforcers of the law of the state, and it's rarely the business of the church what relationship people have with the secular law. But in the case of immigration, I hear so much seething moral condemnation. The only factors that correlate to the outrage seem to be race, religion and ethnicity.

My neighbors set off illegal fireworks all year. Many hunt outside of season without a license. Speeding and other traffic offenses are just a way of life. People buy and sell ""under the table"" to avoid taxes. What about respect for these laws? I don't hear much outrage over this, at least nothing that compares to the utter moral disgust that people claim they have for immigrants--and just to be clear, only immigrants from south of the border. There are actually many undocumented immigrants from Europe and Canada, but again... I don't hear much outrage. But LEGAL immigrants who are refugees from Africa--or who are Muslim--or LEGAL asylum seekers from Central America--and there's all sorts of outrage. 

So is it REALLY about the law? I sincerely ask you to take some time and bring this question to prayer. Where is the outrage really coming from, and is it fair? is the outrage proportional to the actual offense you have identified, and are you equally offended by all parties according to the metric (i.e. the law) that you are using to base this judgment? If not, are you willing to do better?  Are you willing to repent, seek forgiveness and ""sin no more"" (John 8:11)?

‚ÄúThe Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer‚Äô is ‚Äòappalling,‚Äô‚Äù the Herald noted.

The Herald‚Äôs accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren‚Äôs statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: ‚ÄúMSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.‚Äù

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with ‚Äúsomething that reflects our morality.‚Äù She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, ‚ÄúThis is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.‚Äù [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers ‚Äî the same ones Warren derides routinely ‚Äî apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

‚ÄúOn Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,‚Äù The Boston Herald editors wrote. ‚ÄúThose same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.‚Äù

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,‚Äù Warren said in August 2018. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.‚Äù

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"TRUMP‚ÄôS RACISM NEVER ENDS: Donald Trump attacked four of our Democratic Congresswomen of color with racist and threatening language. Then, he continued his insult campaign against Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings, calling his Baltimore district a ‚Äúdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.‚Äù This rhetoric is RACIST and downright UN-AMERICAN. Democrats CANNOT be silent!

You‚Äôve been identified as a top Democrat in your area, so we need to hear from you and just 439 other top Dems before 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT -- but we still haven‚Äôt heard from you. The ONLY way we‚Äôll be able to fight back to stop Donald Trump and his dangerous agenda is by flipping the Senate in 2020 -- so please, take the one-question survey right now and tell us where you stand: Do you approve of Donald Trump?",2019-08-15T23:48:15+0000,the DSCC,0,99,0,999,0.018987,Alabama,0.031646,Colorado,0.031646,Washington,0.126582,California,0.031646,Kansas,0.050633,New York,0.037975,Pennsylvania,0.025316,Virginia,0.018987,Delaware,0.025316,Tennessee,0.006329,"Washington, District of Columbia",0.018987,Georgia,0.050633,Illinois,0.006329,Iowa,0.044304,Minnesota,0.031646,Missouri,0.037975,Ohio,0.063291,Texas,0.018987,Oklahoma,0.018987,Arkansas,0.031646,North Carolina,0.006329,Connecticut,0.06962,Florida,0.006329,Indiana,0.025316,Michigan,0.006329,Mississippi,0.006329,Nebraska,0.006329,New Mexico,0.006329,South Carolina,0.044304,Maryland,0.006329,Vermont,0.006329,West Virginia,0.006329,Wisconsin,0.012658,Wyoming,0.006329,Alaska,0.018987,New Jersey,0.018987,Louisiana,0.018987,Oregon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
