"**Say their names below! The supporters of these unconscionable bills have forgotten the Victims!! The 7000 plus human beings brutally murdered just since 1980 in Massachusetts deserve justice. Permanent justice not temporary justice. The justice that they and their families — the survivors — were guaranteed by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Court!
**Remember these names — Vote them out! Our own elected Senators and Representatives met with 150 First Degree murderers of our loved ones in Norfolk prison March 23, 2019 to discuss helping them get out — long before only one reluctantly met with 25 family members of their victims, at our insistence — yet they have never met with their own constituents to discuss these disgraceful bills! Let them hear your outrage...
Ten years they’ve been “working” to end LWOP in Massachusetts. They will never ever succeed — not for those convicted of First Degree Murder. They know not the wrath of the victims families. We’ve been to hell and back already. We are tougher then they are. We are stronger then they are. We have Said NO to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”!!
Obviously these lawmakers do not know the laws of the state that they represent. A sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole is not given lightly. LWOP is reserved for the worst of the worst. The 1074 inmates currently incarcerated for committing First Degree Murder are such. These cold blooded killers do not deserve the second chance they themselves denied to their own victims. 
The 7000 plus murder victims received a death sentence immediately. No Trials. No Appeals. No Parole. Ever. 
The 70,000 plus survivors received a life sentence immediately the moment their loved ones were murdered. No Trials. No Appeals. No Parole. Ever. 

Say NO to Elimination of Life Without Parole! Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers. Period.

Say NO to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”! Say NO to H.3358/S.826! LWOP means LWOP! #WeNeverForgetTheVictims #BeBrave #JusticeForMurderVictims

"I am pro-choice. That does not mean that I promote abortion but rather believe in a woman's bodily autonomy and liberty to regulate her uterus. You will not shame me or other Catholics for holding this view. But if you're going to try, please throw out your condoms and the pill. Don't waste your seed. Refrain from oral copulation. And be sure to remain chaste until marriage. 

As someone that was born and raised Catholic, I am becoming increasingly disappointed with the Church’s inconsistency, particularly concerning the “sanctity of life” and reproduction. I drove by St. Anne’s Catholic Church in Beaumont earlier this week and saw a sign that stated: “Planned Parenthood separates children from their parents forever”. It's a play on a hot topic in politics today: undocumented immigrants being separated from their children. Rather than posting a sign calling for unity as a nation in protecting families under any circumstance, they hyperfocus on one singular issue. Several signs are displaying similar sentiments outside every church. 

Officially, Catholics have a zero-tolerance policy concerning abortion, no matter the risk imposed on a woman's life. Regardless of whether or not the fetus is viable. If she's raped, too bad. In addition to abortion, per the Church, ANY form of contraception is wrong including condoms, spermicides, intrauterine devices, the pill, etc. Interestingly, there are no signs showing condoms with a big red X. Why is that? Take a look at married couples and the number of children they have sitting in the pews. If they have one or two, they're likely utilizing some form of contraception. If you’re going to rail against abortion, you better keep it consistent and denounce all forms of contraception smack dab in front of the church. And yes, papal encyclicals have indicated that the Church views abortion and contraception as violating the ""natural law"". Keep it consistent or drop it. Those of us that pay attention are getting tired of the selective outrage and feigned moral indignation.",2019-08-10T00:06:01+0000,Citizens4Change,0,99,1000,4999,1,Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Jaime Candelaria, one of the organizers of the El Paso Strong event, echoed Lopez's assessment that Trump's rhetoric is creating a hostile environment for Latinos. Despite that, he said he would focus on doing what was necessary to bring better days to El Paso. ”This is a community trying to come together in love,"" Candelaria said. And he didn't believe Trump would be able to foster the healing needed to lift the city out of its grief.”",2019-08-08T05:43:39+0000,Jaime Candelaria,0,99,0,999,1,Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Scores Of MAGA Fans May Qualify For Darwin Award

-by the editor-

In a lengthy phone interview with the chair of the Darwin Award Selection Committee, Melinda McNamara, 64, she conceded to Tall Hat Telegraph, that “Well, yes, under the current rules, scores of MAGA fans could actually qualify for the Darwin Award.”

According to the current rules, The Darwin Award Selection  Committee “recognize individuals who have supposedly contributed to human evolution by selecting themselves out of the gene pool via death or sterilization by their own actions” (Wilkipidia).

The  controversial statement by McNamara sparked a heated Twitter exchange between Trump supporters calling her statement ‘inflammatory”, and “elitist”, while liberal voters rushed to McNamara’s defense, claiming she was “merely  exorcising her freedom of speech.”

McNamara later posted a disclaimer on the Darwin Award homepage, stating her comment was taken out of context and that she had had a long day.

“Look, all I’m saying is that all the childless first-time voters favoring #45 for a second term, unaware perhaps that his presidency will open the gates of hell, would at their death, and under the current guidelines, be eligible for the award!  

""Now, I fail to see why so many MAGA supporters are taking  umbrage with this.  If the world does end in a flaming inferno, the award and all it stands for would be pretty pointless, right? And there  would be no one left alive to laugh at them. So I suggest everybody take  a chill pill, this award is supposed to be satirical, its not like a gosh dang IQ score or something"" McNamara concludes. 

24 hours later, McNamara’s disclaimer was replaced with a second disclaimer by the vice chair of the committee, Morland Dale, 47.

“We regret the outrage that McNamara’s earlier statement has caused.” Dale  states. “She is now on a paid vacation to an undisclosed location.  And while the board respects her rights under the 1st amendment, we must, respectfully, disagree with her conclusion.""

""If the president's second term does in fact open the gates of hell, his supporters would not be eligible for the award, since the death of all living things are at odds with the rule that a person’s death must ""contribute to human  evolution.""  We, at the board feel that all Trump voters would therefor,  at the end of the world, be automatically & unequivocally  disqualified from consideration!  We hope this clears up any  misunderstandings, and we do apologize for McNamara’s statement earlier.”'",2019-08-04T14:38:29+0000,,0,99,0,999,0.037543,Alabama,0.05802,Pennsylvania,0.017065,New Jersey,0.017065,New Mexico,0.030717,New York,0.023891,North Carolina,0.006826,North Dakota,0.030717,Ohio,0.020478,Oklahoma,0.006826,Oregon,0.006826,Rhode Island,0.013652,Nevada,0.030717,South Carolina,0.003413,South Dakota,0.027304,Tennessee,0.081911,Texas,0.003413,Vermont,0.017065,Virginia,0.023891,Washington,0.003413,West Virginia,0.006826,New Hampshire,0.006826,Nebraska,0.006826,Alaska,0.044369,Indiana,0.020478,Arizona,0.017065,Arkansas,0.037543,California,0.003413,Colorado,0.044369,Florida,0.037543,Georgia,0.003413,Idaho,0.047782,Illinois,0.017065,Iowa,0.003413,Montana,0.010239,Kansas,0.040956,Kentucky,0.010239,Louisiana,0.017065,Maine,0.006826,Maryland,0.020478,Massachusetts,0.05802,Michigan,0.013652,Mississippi,0.040956,Missouri,0.023891,Wisconsin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The exclusively white leaders of ""Stand With Ross Valley Schools"" have misled our community for years - with shameless, right-wing-style, alternate-reality fearmongering propaganda on flimsy ocean-bound plastic signs, cynically manufactured outrage, intimidation, and divisive disinformation - in a vain attempt to dismantle a single small public charter school in Fairfax (among the 60-some-odd public charter schools in Marin, Sonoma, and Napa counties).

The school is thriving and more popular than ever, while Stand dissolves over the smoking ruins of a broken community they've since abandoned without so much as a single apology. (And with $10k of un-refunded GoFundMe donations. The lack of apology is to be expected. But donors should demand – and receive - a refund.)

While Stand tried in vain to obstruct and dismantle the only educational choice available to countless poor, minority, and special needs families living and working in our own community, who can't afford and/or can't get into to private schools (and/or have simply been disenfranchised by the scandal-plagued monopoly traditional school district)...

...others have been championing actual socially progressive causes like equality and choice in public education - in an honest and ethical way.

“I let them know that our hope as Black parents is in charter schools, which are free public schools...”

“Generationally, we haven’t had things like that to hope for,” she continued. “If you take away charter schools, you take away the choice that is helping our children thrive and perform. You are taking away our hope.”

“California’s Charter School law, signed by former Gov. Pete Wilson in 1992, gave the independently-run charter schools (or petitioners interested in creating one) the right to an appeal process if a school district denies their application. The first step would be to appeal the decision with the county board of Education. In 1998, the law was amended, creating a second level of appeal with the State Board of Education.”

“Parents, members of both civil rights organizations and other supporters attending the meeting said they asked the governor’s office to maintain the current appeals process.”",2019-08-04T14:00:00+0000,"families of Ross Valley (San Anselmo and Fairfax, CA)",0,99,1000,4999,1,California,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Border Situation.

This fake “spontaneous"" and manufactured outrage at the condition on the borders is a complete hoax by the desperate democrats. They do not have the slightest concern or interest in the condition of the immigrants. Their intent is strictly for  POLITICAL control.

They shout and even pretend to shed tears of solidarity with the migrants. 
They cry and give these heroic speeches of love of humanity and the concern for the plight of the asylum seekers.

They call the temporary holding facilities 
“Concentration Camps” How disrespectful of the memories of real concentration camp victims  and the millions who were murdered in them !

They say that they are forced to drink water from
 “toilet bowls”. There is no end to the shameless  and false slander they cast on innocent “opponents”. 
They say that they tear away children from the arms of their mothers and divide them from their parents. They “rip them away “.Their fake outrage is far removed from any concern of the human conditions of these migrants. It is all about politics and letting in more illegals to get more votes.    

 Now, they do not just say screen them and then let them in. They blatantly say legalize illegal immigration. Open borders for all.

It is a sick mindset so hypocritical and damaging to the country. But they do it for power !
every decent human being, every American, is  concerned about impoverished and in some cases desperate migrants. But every country has visas or a method of allowing immigrants to come in their country in an orderly fashion. 

These liberal hypocrites would have you believe that they have a monopoly on compassion. Far from it, they are the most intolerant, manipulative beings in present day American politics. They smear and demonize totally innocent people carrying out the law. Testimony after testimony and hearing after hearing ! They never work ! their job has become an orchestrated disinformation campaign aimed towards the gullible, the uninformed and the naive and the needy.

Once again, for those who like to blur the lines and say you are anti immigrant ! No, I am for LEGAL immigrants ! If you are too stupid to know the difference, too bad for you ! This country was built by immigrants ! lawful, legal immigrants.

There are thousands who have waited a long time, with dignity, waiting to take their turn and the oath to become LEGAL citizens. The democrats know that those coming through legal channels have not been bribed to vote for them by their party.

The President and the country should facilitate orderly legal immigration. They should expedite it and use proper criteria to allow how many and who to come in ! 

The multi lateral efforts of the democrats in wanting thousands of so called “asylum"" seekers or illegal immigrants to come in the country is well orchestrated. It has been completely and thoroughly politically organized. The actions they are taking are no coincidence ! 

It has been been organized in secret behind closed doors and  with their party leaders and their “strategists"" and “pundits” and the fake news, MSM. The swamp leaders have thought  long and hard as to how to implement this hoax on the American people. 

Here is what is unfolding:

1- Let it be known that the borders are open and ENCOURAGE vast numbers of people to FLOOD the borders. 
Bring children, as MANY as you can, whether yours or other children
2- Make it seem like a crisis of epic proportions and display outrage and vilify the other party,the border patrol and ICE. Demonize the government agencies trying to enforce the law. 
3- Ask to abolish ICE and the border patrol and the government agencies including DHS because of their ""inhumane treatment"" of the migrants. !!!
4- Deny funding to ameliorate the conditions of the thousands being  held and shout foul.This will make sure the conditions get worse as more come in.
5- Legalize illegal immigrants coming in.
6-Give them all benefits including drivers licenses and healthcare and other benefits.
7- Clandestinely register them to vote.
8- Make sure they vote for the democrats.

Continue having secret meetings with pundits and strategists and the fake news, MSM to push this narrative and demonize the President and the Conservatives and ICE as inhuman and heartless racists !

Hit all the airwaves and MSM and talk shows to push this agenda and narrative. 
The talking points are already agreed upon and fully rehearsed ! 
It is no coincidence that their talking points are totally identical because it is well rehearsed and orchestrated. Completely scripted and thought out.

They have plants in all the media and even government agencies who will unfortunately go along with this hoax because of a shared ideology. They are part of the swamp ! That is called REAL collusion !!

It is no coincidence that Cuomo signed a bill granting driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants recently.
It is no coincidence that Gavin Newsom  granted illegals free health care in California just recently
it is no coincidence to call for the legalization of all illegal aliens or “ undocumented workers “
It is no coincidence to start calling for the dismantling of DHS and abolishing ICE.

This is part of a well orchestrated effort by the left to gain power. It has NOTHING to do with any humanitarian concern for the plight of immigrants !
I wish it did !

It is strictly about illegal VOTES. 
Be ready,  when you request it to be a requirement to have voter ID, they will

"Hello Folks,

Don’t be misled by talk of a lower tax rate.  In markets like ours where property values are soaring, you must look solely to the revenue to determine if year to year tax adjustments are reasonable.

Last year Saginaw experienced a Growth Rate of 2.99%.  Add that to a reasonable Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) of 3% you will find that a reasonable adjustment to cover necessity in the 5% range.  The reality is, like most other cities in the state, Saginaw took extreme advantage of the property value boom and masked a massive 19.5% revenue increase behind a lower tax rate.  This action triggered outrage among state law makers who were successful this year in making such egregious overreaches illegal.

The law passed by the state this year does not take effect until next fiscal year, so I encourage you to ignore talk about tax rates, and focus your attention on the actual revenue increase.

Just remember that 5% of 200 is equal to 10% of 100.

In service to You.

"I was at the Lights for Liberty march and vigil this past Friday along with several hundreds of our neighbors and allies to express our outrage over what is happening to immigrants and asylum seekers in our country.

To see such a large and diverse group of people coming together in solidarity for a peaceful demonstration was powerful and inspiring. The few folks who trespassed on private property and took down the United States and Colorado flags do not represent the rest of the people who were present at the event, and the ensuing discussion has been a major distraction from the issue that brought us out to the vigil in the first place.

People are being wrenched apart from their families and being held in cages on our soil for seeking asylum or for the equivalent of having an unpaid parking ticket. One of those facilities is in Aurora, and is run by a private prison company to boot.

"US Attorney General William Barr Decides Not to Prosecute in the Tragic Eric Garner Case

Yesterday, US Attorney General William Barr made the final decision not to charge New York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo with violating the Civil Rights of Eric Garner who died approximately five years ago on July 17th, 2014 as a result of a chokehold that Officer Pantaleo placed Garner in when he was detained allegedly for selling untaxed, loose cigarettes. According to an NBC News article, Garner, 43, who was asthmatic, was being arrested for allegedly selling untaxed, loose cigarettes. His death on July 17, 2014, sparked national outrage and protests. The phrase ""I can't breathe"" — which he said 11 times during his arrest — became a rallying cry for police reform.

A medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide, saying the chokehold was the cause. Chokeholds are prohibited by the New York Police Department. Pantaleo has said that he performed a legal move called the ""seatbelt"" on Garner. 

Attorney General Barr made the final decision not to charge Pantaleo, however, notwithstanding the recommendation of attorneys in the Civil Rights Division of the US Justice Department who thought that charges should have been filed according to NBC. 
If the decision had been made to pursue charges against the officer, then he would, of course, had his day in court to explain why he took the actions which were taken that resulted in Garner’s death; however, Barr’s decision not to prosecute in light of the circumstances causes one to understand why many have lost faith in the US Justice Department under the current administration.",2019-07-17T02:59:32+0000,McKissick for NC Senate,0,99,1000,4999,0.839919,North Carolina,0.090848,South Carolina,0.032084,Tennessee,0.036474,Virginia,0.000675,Georgia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness for ALL?

We at Resist reflect on this nation’s promise to its citizens: the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” A promise that has been broken time and time again as those most impacted by oppression are restricted to the margins of society - bereft of resources, options, and hope. And today is no different. 
 
Our worst fears are being realized.
 
Emboldened by Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation, right-wing lawmakers are introducing anti-abortion legislature with the explicit goal of overturning Roe v. Wade… and denying all people of their reproductive rights. 

We knew this fight was coming. Which is why, thanks to you, our grantees are at clinics, schools, community centers, and in the streets fighting misinformation and prejudice at every turn.
 
Now we need you and every other Resister to express the full magnitude of your disgust and outrage today because the Trump agenda is as ugly as it gets. We need to raise $135,000 by July 31st to make sure that our grantees hold
strong in these hostile times; that they protect the rights of all people, especially those living on the edge.

You and I know that abortion bans and heartbeat bills have never been about “saving lives”—they’re about perpetuating systemic racism and sexism, and above all, control.
 
The United States is one of only 13 countries in the world where the maternal mortality rate is WORSE than it was 15 years ago, and Black women are four times more likely to die in childbirth than their white counterparts. Resist grantee Southern Birth Justice Network (1) refuses to be complacent. 

Through direct community outreach, popular education, and engaging storytelling, Southern Birth Justice Network is advocating for proper and comprehensive health care across the pregnancy spectrum, including abortion, miscarriage, prenatal, birth, and postpartum care. They provide teens and parents with alternative birthing options, midwifery, and doula care—vital tools for survival not found anywhere else in their community.

Southern Birth Justice Network is doing what policymakers won’t: protecting the people and families who need our help.

""If the captain of USWST were a Christian, would she be allowed to waive a Christian flag and parade around with a Bible? We can’t begin to imagine the outrage from the liberal media…but Rapinoe can proudly say, 'You can't win a championship without gays on your team. It's never been done before. That's science right there…go gays!'""

TOWNHALL - The Left has, once again, proven how truly disgusting they are. Their nasty tactics have hit a new low.

"America has often expressed outrage, engaged in sanctions and declared human rights violations across the globe.  What is being revealed about the treatment of children and people in detention camps is inexcusable and creates a call for immediate action.  

We learn history repeats itself.

TOWNHALL - The Left has, once again, proven how truly disgusting they are. Their nasty tactics have hit a new low. Ava Martinez, known to most of us as ""Mini AOC,"" frequently recorded parody videos and took photos making fun of the real Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Apparently Alexandria Ocasio Cortez fans didn't like the 8-year-old's content so they started doxxing and threatening Martinez and her family.

"SONG OF THE DAY – July 9
SARAH JONES – “Your Revolution”

Alice Paul, a leader of the women’s suffrage movement and who helped draft what became the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution, died on this day in 1977 at the age of 92 in Moorestown, NJ.  

(From Onthisdeity.com) 

At 29, she instigated a campaign dedicated to the passage of a constitutional amendment for women’s suffrage and went head-to-head with the federal government and President Woodrow Wilson. She played a pivotal role in bringing about the passage of the 19th amendment in 1919, but what this decisive moment in America’s development owes to Alice Paul’s militancy is often criminally overlooked because history has adopted a less controversial narrative of the women’s suffrage movement.

Alice understood that for a federal campaign to succeed, it needed to have the support of the president. She got his full attention when she staged a suffrage procession of some 8,000 strong in Washington D.C. on the eve of Woodrow Wilson’s 1913 inauguration. Though Alice had done her part to organise a peaceful march, an unruly crowd assaulted the suffragists while police stood by and did nothing. The next day, Alice Paul stole Wilson’s inaugural thunder when news of the near-riot made headlines. Over the next four years, she would become one of the prickliest thorns in the 
president’s side.

In January 1917, on the eve of America’s involvement in the First World War, she stationed members in front of the White House. No American – male or female – had ever before conceived of this now time-honoured protest tactic. Alice Paul was the first.

When Alice unveiled her banner indicting “Kaiser Wilson” for hypocrisy in fighting an overseas war for democracy while 20,000,000 American women remained disenfranchised, a group of soldiers tore the “treacherous” banners to shreds and violently attacked the female picketers. Instead of arresting the attackers, the police arrested the women for “obstructing traffic”. 168 suffragists were sent to jail – most of them to a former men’s prison with male guards and open toilets, rotten food and dirty sheets. In an attempt to discredit Alice Paul, she was declared insane and placed in a psychiatric prison. Demanding to be recognised as political prisoners, Alice and many others went on hunger strike and were subsequently subjected to brutal forced-feedings. Then, on 15th November 1917, some forty guards with clubs went on a rampage, terrorising thirty-three jailed suffragists. They beat, grabbed, dragged, choked, slammed, pinched, twisted, and kicked the defenceless women.

News of the so-called “Night of Terror” leaked out to newspapers, causing public outrage. The militants’ stubborn protests, however reviled they may have been, created a situation in which something had to be done. In January 1918, Woodrow Wilson publicly announced his support of woman suffrage. Two years later, the 19thamendment was finally ratified. Alice Paul’s militancy had worked.

For Alice Paul, however, the struggle did not end with the right to vote, which did not fully correct the fact that women were discriminated against: “The ballot is the symbol of a new status in human society, it is the greatest possible single step forward in the progress of women, but it does not in itself complete their freedom.” In 1923, Alice Paul drafted the Equal Rights Amendment – the final step in women’s struggle for full legal equality.",2019-07-09T11:08:37+0000,J Matthew Ash,0,99,0,999,0.009396,Colorado,0.02953,North Carolina,0.016107,Massachusetts,0.055034,Michigan,0.042953,Minnesota,0.018792,Missouri,0.008054,Montana,0.010738,Nevada,0.008054,New Hampshire,0.009396,New Jersey,0.004027,New Mexico,0.037584,New York,0.040268,Ohio,0.020134,Kentucky,0.01745,Oklahoma,0.028188,Oregon,0.028188,Pennsylvania,0.01745,South Dakota,0.022819,Tennessee,0.04698,Texas,0.002685,Utah,0.009396,Vermont,0.018792,Virginia,0.051007,Washington,0.014765,Maine,0.012081,Kansas,0.004027,Louisiana,0.033557,Arizona,0.012081,Maryland,0.004027,Mississippi,0.009396,Nebraska,0.004027,North Dakota,0.004027,Rhode Island,0.010738,South Carolina,0.006711,West Virginia,0.006711,Wyoming,0.034899,Alabama,0.001342,Alaska,0.01745,Arkansas,0.01745,Iowa,0.060403,California,0.002685,Connecticut,0.004027,Delaware,0.001342,"Washington, District of Columbia",0.04698,Florida,0.018792,Georgia,0.008054,Hawaii,0.012081,Idaho,0.041611,Illinois,0.040268,Indiana,0.01745,Wisconsin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Donald Trump’s attack on immigrants and asylum seekers knows no limits. From Border Patrol agents stripping children of their blankets and sleeping mats to outbreaks of lice and disease, the conditions of the camps detaining immigrant children are cruel and inhumane.

"A year ago, when Trump was separating migrant children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border, tens of thousands of MoveOn members rose up and forced Trump to end the horrific policy.

TOWNHALL - The Left has, once again, proven how truly disgusting they are. Their nasty tactics have hit a new low. Ava Martinez, known to most of us as ""Mini AOC,"" frequently recorded parody videos and took photos making fun of the real Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Apparently Alexandria Ocasio Cortez fans didn't like the 8-year-old's content so they started doxxing and threatening Martinez and her family.

"AN OPEN LETTER TO CYRUS VANCE JR. MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY

Cyrus Vance Jr.
Manhattan District Attorney
1 Hogan Pl
New York, NY 10013

Dear Cyrus Vance Jr.

You’re in charge of what was once one of the country’s most respected prosecutor’s offices. Those who work for you, maybe not even friends or family, will tell you to your face -- but you’re going to have a difficult time reclaiming what remains of your reputation, and with it the reputation of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. 

Manhattan resident Donald J. Trump, by his own admission, has been sexually assaulting women for years. More than twenty women – and nobody knows how many more there have been -- have come forward with accounts of sexual assaults ranging from unwanted kissing, being pinned against walls, groped and grabbed in their genitals, and yes, forcible rape. 

Even Ivana Trump, in a sworn deposition, stated that he had raped her during their marriage (Though she softened her charge with a ponderous word salad about love and marriage following an undisclosed financial settlement.). No matter, 

Donald Trump is recorded on tape describing the very acts he’s accused of and always denies everything with his con man gestures and his abominable one-liners, “She’s not my type.” “I don’t think so.”

One woman says she was repeatedly raped by Trump and his notorious friend, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. She was 13-years old at the time, one of at least 80 very young girls who Epstein recruited to his Palm Beach Mansion for sex with him and his as yet undisclosed friends.
 
The Miami Herald quoted Courtney Wild, who said she had been one of his recruiters, “He told me he wanted them as young as I could find them….as many girls as I could get him. It was never enough.’’

Epstein faced life in prison.Jeffrey Epstein at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, 10021.

Donald Trump: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it ― Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” 

Heh, Heh—It’s all good fun, Donald.

Some of whom claimed Donald raped them as well.

Meet the U.S. Secretary of Labor

In 2007, then U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta gave Epstein immunity from prosecution and he pleaded guilty to a relatively minor charge. He spent 13 months in “work release” in his luxurious Palm Beach offices though he did have to return to sleep in the County Jail.  

Until now, Epstein has not been forced or even asked to reveal anyone else in his circle of privileged pedophiles. In fact, the plea deal specifically shielded co-conspirators—a bizarre deal.   Acosta made sure In Trump parlance, that Epstein didn’t “rat anyone out.” Acosta is now Trump's Secretary of Labor!

Acosta strung along the rape victims until the plea deal was done. In February, a federal judge agreed with the victims that that Acosta’s failure to tell them and give them a chance to protest the deal, violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act.  
Department of Justice Officials led by Trump’s very own Roy Cohn, Attorney General William Barr, admit that Acosta violated the law. But they say they have the discretion not to reopen the case and prosecute -- and they’re using it. 

Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and the slap on the wrist he had received for it, in a 2011 interview with the New York Post: “Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City – and making wisecracks about his just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl. ‘I am not a sexual predator, I’m an “offender,”’ the financier told The Post yesterday. “‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel,’ said Epstein.” February 25, 2011, New York Post “Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a Sex Offender Not A Predator”

But we are assured that the federal prosecutors will receive additional training in the Crime Victims' Rights Act—something like requiring Ted Bundy, the serial killer of young women, to take a course in anger management.

And there sits Alex Acosta, eminently qualified for Donald Trump’s cabinet, confirmed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.

Some Nervous Pedophiles May Be Looking For Countries With Non-Extradition Treaties

On July 3, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the federal judge's order that sealed the court documents in the complaint by several victims that the secret plea deal Acosta made with Epstein was illegal--As noted that claim has been upheld and conceded by Trump's Roy Cohen, William Barr's Department of Justice. In its opinion the three-judge court observed:

""These petitioners included in their filings not only descriptions of sexual abuse by Epstein, but also new allegations of sexual abuse by several other prominent individuals, “including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well‐known Prime Minister, and other world leaders,”

Trump’s Support for Roy Moore, Alabama’s Most Prominent Pedophile Wasn’t Only Political Expediency—Moore is a Good Old Boy Who Likes ‘Em Young—Just Like the President

The 13-year old child who was raped by Epstein and his friends, said Trump was one of them. It didn’t get the media attention one might have imagined because the woman through her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, canceled a press conference that would have revealed her identity. 

On November 2, 2016—right before the election: “Press conference cancelled, Jane Doe has received numerous threats, afraid to show her face. -Lisa Bloom”

Two days later: “Jane Doe instructed us to dismiss her lawsuit against Trump and Epstein today. Tough week for her. We wish her well.”

Mr. Vance, how can you read this without feeling the outrage that all decent people feel? The difference between you and the rest of us is that you can do something about it. Thus far, as the following cases suggest, it seems you’re just not up to the job.

You Give a Pass to Serial Sex Offender Harvey Weinstein

A Filipina-Italian model who said she was in the Hollywood mogul’s Tribeca office when he suddenly grabbed her breasts and put his hand up her skirt at. She fled. The NYPD put Weinstein under surveillance. Under police direction, she arranged a meeting with Weinstein at the Tribeca Grand Hotel later that month. She wore a wire. The NYPD guaranteed her safety and waited in a room close to Weinstein’s. They wanted to catch him in the attempt. 

She had agreed to go upstairs with him but panicked at the last moment and couldn’t go through with it. Nonetheless, after hearing the conversation between the two of them, when he came downstairs, the police officers took him in for questioning. The audio revealed what was at least a tacit admission: ""I'm a famous guy ... I'm used to that….I won’t do it again. I swear on my children. Just come up to the suite while I take a shower.” 

Ech! That’s one disgusting pig of a man. 
 
NYPD said publicly that they believed they had ample evidence to make an arrest. He (rightfully and wisely) demanded a lawyer. They had to release him.
According to you, she had “credibility problems.” You dropped the case. Shortly thereafter, Weinstein paid her $1 million for her silence. 

“I thought I needed to support my mom and brother and how my life was being destroyed, and I did it,” she told a reporter.  

You Give a Pass to the “Rutting Chimpanzee,” Serial Sex Offender, Dominique Strauss-Kahn

You dropped charges against the former head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss-Kahn who was accused by a maid at New York’s Sofitel Hotel of attempted rape and other related crimes. She too had “credibility issues.”
 
He filed a countersuit for at least $1 million against the hotel maid. But after you dropped the charges, he settled her civil law suit for an undisclosed sum. 
 
In an interview with a French television station, he said the incident at the Sofitel Hotel was ""not only an inappropriate relationship, but more than that -- an error, a mistake, a mistake concerning my wife, my children, my friends, but also a mistake that the French people placed their hope in change on me.""  

An “inappropriate relationship?” “An error concerning my wife and children and friends?”

Strauss-Kahn was charged with helping procure sex workers for a prostitution ring based at a hotel in France. Let’s call it what the prosecutors called it—“aggravated pimping.”

He said that prosecutors had exaggerated the frequency of his ""licentious evenings."" There had only been 12 in three years. Moreover, he hadn’t organized the orgies and he didn’t know they were prostitutes. (Just as Epstein, Strauss-Kahn said he didn’t know the children were under age) He was acquitted. Okay, people can live with that—At least prosecutors didn’t give him a pass. He had to face a trial.

In 2011, just when Strauss-Kahn was facing New York prosecution, or so people thought, Tristane Banon, a 32-years old French writer and journalist, filed a criminal complaint in France against him. She had gone to his apartment to interview him when he was the French finance minister. Her lawyer told CNN that the alleged attack had taken place with ""extreme violence.” He filed a counterclaim for ""false declarations.""

""When I entered that flat, I immediately felt ill at ease,"" she told 'l'Express' magazine.

""We started talking a bit, he offered me a coffee, I got out my Dictaphone, he wanted us to go on the couch, then that I hold his hand to reply -- 'Otherwise I won't manage,' he said.
""I wanted to leave. He stopped the Dictaphone, caught me by the arm. I asked him to let me go, and that's when the fight started.""

She had described the attack in a 2007 television program, likening him to a ""rutting chimpanzee"". She said her mother, an official in Strauss-Kahn's Socialist party, dissuaded her from filing a complaint at the time. But watching him freed without bail and dining in a New York restaurant ""sickened"" her.

Banon said, women face obstacles in bringing rape charges against people like Strauss –Kahn.  She wanted to forget about it. And she knew she would likely fail because it was the word of a young writer over a powerful figure. But ""If I want one day to put an end to this hell of the past eight years, it has to go to court.""

Ultimately, the French public prosecutor dropped the charges, finding insufficient evidence to prosecute Strauss-Kahn for attempted rape, but he said “acts that could be qualified as sexual aggression were established.” Unlike the attempted rape charge—which carried a statute of limitations of 10 years—sexual assault offenses can only be prosecuted three years after they were committed.

Mr. Vance: Now A Forcible Rape Victim Comes Forward With Corroborating Evidence. The Case Isn’t Barred By The Statute of Limitations. It Occurs in Manhattan—And It’s Against Donald Trump What Are You Going To Do About It?

A highly credible woman, E. Jean Carroll tells her story of forcible rape in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. Never mind all the other sexual assaults, never mind Trump’s admissions on the Access Hollywood tape, Carroll’s account of forcible rape by the president of the United States is corroborated by two credible witnesses whom she told right after it happened.  

One woman offered to go to the police with her and the other advised her “Tell no one. Forget it! He has 200 lawyers. He’ll bury you.” 

She took the second friend’s advice. Given the abuse and humiliation that so many other rape victims have suffered, who can say she was wrong? Brett Kavanagh has a lifetime Supreme Court seat and Trump sits in the White House. 
     
But E. Jean Carroll has described a forcible rape, a class B felony. As you know, the episode is not barred by New York’s statute of limitations. Though she may not want to pursue a criminal prosecution, Ms. Carroll has publicly revealed the details. Accordingly, a violation of her privacy isn’t a consideration. Even if it were--and no matter how important he is or how difficult a prosecution may be--the need to prosecute anyone who poses such a dire threat to public safety far outweighs all other considerations.
 
Sure, one or more women might have been lying. Maybe there wasn’t enough evidence against Weinstein or Strauss-Kahn.   We should all applaud cautious prosecutors who by bringing an indictment can destroy a person’s life. 

I’ve been a defense lawyer and a prosecutor, I’ve seen women, angry at their lovers or husbands, falsely accuse them, sometimes even of molesting their step daughters. And we all know that men lie and pay off prosecutors and witnesses and even judges to conceal their crimes, none more than this president.

Recall the Florida Attorney General who dropped fraud charges involving the students of “Trump University.” Trump’s bogus “charitable” foundation, which since then has been closed down by the New York State Attorney General, illegally paid her $25,000 as a “campaign contribution.” 

Mr. Vance, I haven’t bothered to examine the criminal law surrounding that illegal payoff—have you?

It’s highly unlikely that Ms. Carroll is concocting her story, and most of us are reasonably sure that most, if not all of these other women are telling the truth as well. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has no credibility at all.

Presumably, you wouldn’t allow the survivor of a presidential shooting on 5th Avenue the option to forget about it. You would prosecute the shooter and require the victim to testify.  

Or is New York City already Saddam Hussein country in which “the Leader” and his children could  get away with anything?
  
Many of Trump’s sexual and financial crimes—and who doesn’t understand the tax frauds, the insurance frauds, the bank frauds, the money laundering, and who knows what else—the crimes thus far committed with impunity over decades? 

That he has gotten away with so much for so long is an indictment of New York politicians – Democrats and Republicans – including especially New York City prosecutors who have jurisdiction.

Together with you, Trump, his good friend, Jeffrey Epstein, I've posted the photo of the serial sexual predator--a subway groper but as far as we know, not a pedophile or forcible rapist. I'll bet you go after him with all you've got--and you should. But giving Trump and his friends a pass is inexcusable--and I've barely scratched the surface.

"RUGA RUGA EVERYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

By Adabekee Osondi Owendi, 6 July 2019

THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IS FULL OF COWARDS SO RENDERED BY THE MEMBERS BEING INEPT AND CORRUPT. Thus majority of the members lack the simple courage to confront this problem. 

WHAT DO I MEAN? 
Should the National Assembly remain this impotent in defining what the law should be about land utilization, government forced land-grabbing (known as Eminent domain here) and the like?

Where there's this much outrage in the country on the ""RUGA POLICY"" shouldn't the lawmakers be taking advantage of the national outrage to craft laws that protect citizens from forced land grabbing? 

With lawmakers from the middlebelt down to all the southern states,  one would expect that their should be enough members to override any impending presidential veto.

BUT BEING SO STAINED IN EMBEZZLEMENT AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, THESE FOLKS MAY NOT HAVE THE GUT TO ACT.

"Yesterday I had the great pleasure of meeting with our neighbor Jeffrey at Bootstrap Coffee Roasters

Jeffrey is a Ward 2 resident and also works in Ward 2.  To my surprise, Jeffrey and I had already met at a previous happy hour.  We met at a happy hour intended to hear residents of Ward 2. Yet both Jeffrey and I (attending for 2 very different reasons) left that happy hour feeling less than positive about actually being heard. 

This happy hour was just about a year ago.  I remember leaving the meeting moved by Jeffrey’s passion and his activism.  He was well researched and most importantly speaking on behalf of the people who would be most affected by minimum wage increase and tips credits (small business owners and their employees). 

When we reconnected yesterday, we were surprised how in the last year, our journeys brought us back to each other.  It was a wonderful surprise.  Yet the underlying reason for our meeting is less than wonderful. We both came together expressing how our neighbors, colleagues and in Jeffery’s case: the industry was not being heard at City Hall. 

Jeffrey talks of the great work done by Councilmember Jane Prince but counters that with the lack of effort and energy from the councilmember that means the most to him, his own. Despite the time and energy Jeffrey and his colleagues put into having their voices heard, it all fell flat here in Ward 2.

"Antifa is a vicious, violent left wing gang which uses Nazi stormtrooper tactics to terrorize political opponents. I saw them in action in Washington, D.C. the night of President Trump’s Inauguration, rampaging through the streets and destroying property.

Just recently masked Antifa goons in Portland, Oregon brutally attacked a journalist causing a brain hemorrhage while police -carrying out Mayor Ted Wheeler’s policy - took no action. This is similar to the approach Mayor Wheeler took when he ordered the Police not to protect ICE Headquarters in Portland when it was under siege by demonstrators. 

This hands off policy toward left wing violence is disgraceful. The Mayor’s response that anyone identified as taking part in violent attacks will be prosecuted is absurd since Antifa agitators wear masks to hide their identity. 

Politics can and should be hard fought. But that clash of ideas must not be waged by goon squads in the streets or screaming mobs. That is why I condemn all political violence whether it is carried out by left wing demonstrators in the 1960’s and ‘70’s, right wing, racist mobs in Charlottesville; or Antifa today.

Selective outrage is hypocritical. It is time for good Americans across the political spectrum to denounce all political violence. It is also time, as commentators like F. H. Buckley have called for, to have federal law enforcement step in when local officials refuse to protect their citizens.

TOWNHALL - The Left has, once again, proven how truly disgusting they are. Their nasty tactics have hit a new low. Ava Martinez, known to most of us as ""Mini AOC,"" frequently recorded parody videos and took photos making fun of the real Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Apparently Alexandria Ocasio Cortez fans didn't like the 8-year-old's content so they started doxxing and threatening Martinez and her family.

"🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Following the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther began printing bibles in German so ordinary people could read it.

This was an outrage to the church of the time- because if they remained in Latin, only priests could tell people what their faith demanded.

Martin Luther and his reformation brought people one step closer to their Creator. One level of humanity was removed from their superior position.

This helped to cause our entire society to question authority and what granted it to those in power. 

Enlightenment thinkers like Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke and others contrasted the necessity of government against the rights of the people.

The powers given not just granted to kings- but ALL PEOPLE.

And then one day, a government was formed based on those ideas.

That NO GOVERNMENT is valid unless it respects the rights of the people. 

They sat in a large room and wrote it all down.

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.""

Never forget how special this country is!!
