"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters.

Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters.

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America.

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters.

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters.

Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America. Let’s all work to find meaningful ways to let them know they are supported equally in the days of their triumphs and in the days where their lack of desire to play by the old-boys rules are being used against them. 

There really is so much to be said for feeding each other on our dreams. Please do all you can to keep the flaps of this tent we are in open to all those who oppose the inhumanity the Republican Party has come to embrace. Let’s give a little help to all those seeking refuge from this administration. Through being friends with each other we will get by.

Thanks for absolutely everything,

Bill

"Sure-compare America to '30s Germany—But it’s '60s/'70s America where the history we need lives. 
Penzeys Woodstock Matters Week offers end 8.22.19

Two weeks ago with the killings in El Paso, the reality of what America’s Republican Party has become stopped being deniable. As the president’s intentional creation of fear and dehumanizing of Hispanic Americans turned into mass murder, what may well have been the last chance to turn the party away from the path towards 1930s Germany-style nationalism quite probably ended in the silence of Republican Party leaders. The time for belief in a decency deep down in republican voters that will set this right has passed. Intervention is now our only hope. 

Yes, today’s republicans are not yet 1943 Nazis, but no one honest is denying the parallels between the two parties. Today the only real debate is how far along the Nazi timeline republicans are. But as much as the 1930s Germany comparison is accurate, the value of the analogy is somewhat limited because no one in 1930s Europe had any successful idea on how to stop them. 

Plus, for all the buffoonery of the president, the actual workings of the Republican Party in the age of unlimited political spending and targeted social media are far more calculated and far more sophisticated than anything the Nazis of eighty years ago ever dreamed of. We are up against something quite formidable. 

As I’ve shared before, I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that history and spices are so intertwined. The biggest moments in our history are always about the conflict between inhumanity and our human kindness. Spices matter because of our innate desire to care for those around us that became inseparable from the evolution to our DNA once cooking entered our lives a million years ago. Before cooking, strength was in the ability to drive others away. With the abundance cooking brought, strength came in welcoming others in. Sadly our pre-human DNA of fear and mistrust lives in us as well. 

History always has wisdom to offer in times of conflict. It’s just a matter of what history, where? I’m putting my chips on the roadblock to fascism that we are now passing over the fiftieth anniversary of. What in American history ever brought down a corrupt president? Peace, Flowers, Freedom and Happiness. It’s time to go all in.

So much of what Penzeys is comes directly from that Big Bang of Humanity that was the sixties. Growing up in the wake of that time, long ago I came to realize we owe such a debt to all those that gave of themselves to make that humanity happen. Our message of: 

Cooking is

What happens when

You care about people 

would be so much harder to get across without the groundswell in humanity that so many in the sixties gave so much of themselves to bring to life. 

To celebrate all that Woodstock symbolizes, through Thursday 8.22.19 just $5 in spending gets you both a free Heal the World Dish Towel/Superhero Cape and a really nice half-cup jar of our brand new freeze-dried Penzeys Minced Onions. And though virtually all of us missed the chance to be at Woodstock, in most cases because of the timing of our births, don’t miss your chance to get your very-much-inspired-by-the-burst-of-compassion-and-human-kindness-that-was-the-‘60s Heal the World dish towel. The tide is very much turning.

To get your coupons for free with $5 purchase $6.95 Heal the World towel and $4 Penzeys Minced Onion click here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also sign you up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails which, if you care about what we are trying to do, is the absolute best way to help us do what we do. 

There’s a lot of happiness in the way we see and share cooking. Hope, too. And hope is the thing. It sure looks like Election Day 11.3.20 will come down to whether or not the forces of unlimited political spending can get decent, caring, kind Americans to abandon hope. And as much as I wish they weren’t, they are quite good at what they do. The whole point to our Voice Of Cooking email list is to get the best of them. Please-please encourage all those you know who might appreciate/need the regular reminder of hope that comes with the kindness and compassion that cooks so freely share to sign up as well. This all matters. 

Our Voice Of Cooking sign up is right here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html

Of course actually placing an order with us now and again is pretty sweet, too.

Online at penzeys.com, after reaching $5 in spending simply enter 49555C in the apply code box at checkout for your free Onions and then LOVE for your free Heal the World towel. It’s easy. No need to place the onions or the towel in your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. 

Through Thursday the 22nd we also have a pretty good deal on our great Ground Cumin https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s and ever so nice Mural of Flavor https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mural-of-flavor/c-24/p-219/pd-s

And a very big thank-you to all those that responded to me at bill@penzeys.com with my request for your Woodstock/Sixties stories. I’m still looking for more if you have them to share. What you experienced is exactly what we need to be sharing right though the first Tuesday in November, 2020. Your prescription for clear vision is exactly what the doctor is ordering. Fifty years ago America experienced a peace-through-strength movement we need to relive.

And let’s be truly thankful for all those who were young at Woodstock and went on to give of themselves to give us fifty years of much-needed expanding environmental protection and far greater equality. At the same time, let’s be inspired by what the young can achieve and do all we can to support the amazing groundswell of young people already starting to have some pretty impressive success in making an even more perfect America. 

That those who stand in opposition to the current administration and its supporters come from every age is possibly our greatest strength. Of course their playbook is to turn strength into weakness, so we must be ready for them to attempt to turn the primary season into age-based infighting. I think there is great fun to be had in not taking their bait.

Progress is not a naturally occurring process that happens all by itself when those who are older step out of the way. Progress must be won and often only through hard-fought battles with the dragons of discrimination and the dragons of destruction of nature that roam our land. Endangered Species Acts don’t just pop up out of nowhere. We owe so much to those who spent the last fifty years in the trenches. 

At the same time we can’t buy into their fable that young people today don’t want to really work for change but only want to blame those who came before them for everything being less than perfect. Let’s not buy that one either. The newly emerging young leaders are a thoughtful, dedicated, caring bunch so very much in tune with the spirit of America.

This is nothing more than a backdoor tax hike disguised as a “contest.” Who does the Governor think he’s fooling? New York State taxpayers deserve better.

"ARTUR DAVIS IS LACKING IN CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY!
Artur Davis not only voted against Obamacare, but he voted with the corporate Republicans the vast majority of the time, even though he was a Democrat representing Alabama Congressional District 7, which included the Black Belt.

What Artur Davis tried to do to the Democratic Party's major issues, and the first Black President of the US, in a failed attempt get elected Governor of Alabama, demonstrated his basic flaws in his character! After Davis had receive total support from President and Mrs. Obama and 90% of the Democrats in Alabama, he voted against the President's signature issue, ""Obamacare."" If his vote had prevailed, it would have had ramifications for generations to come. Not only would it have resulted in the death of 562 poor people a year in the state of Alabama, but it may have resulted in a failed Presidency of the first Black President. The image would have eroded the hopes, dreams, confidence and aspirations of young Black boys and girls for generations in America.

After the President’s Health Care Plan was approved by one vote, and the Democrats solidly rejected Artur Davis’ bid for Governor, Artur Davis still on his mission to destroy President Obama and the Party, went to the Republican National Convention. He boldly declared his support for Mitt Romney for President in an effort to ensure President Obama would go down in history as a failed Presidency! Artur Davis failed again because of the same reason, lack of integrity. After the Republicans discorded him like a used condom, he returned to Montgomery to continue his deceit by attempting to con the people again in the Mayoral Race.

"So much is at stake in the 2020 elections - our homes, our businesses, our children's safety and education, and even our Democracy depend on who we elect to draw our district maps in the 87th #TXlege session. To add even more pressure, whatever happens here in Texas in 2020 has critical national implications due to the 38 electoral college votes that come with us. 

""In a longtime Republican district covering a wealthy enclave of Dallas, Democratic challenger Shawn Terry has raised $235,000, an eye-popping amount for a statehouse race that’s more than a year away.""",2019-08-21T01:11:00+0000,Shawn for Texas,0,99,5000,9999,1,Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"”1 Timothy 2:1-2 says, “First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.”

Here in 1 Timothy 2:1-2, the Apostle Paul focuses on matters relating to the Church—His people, more broadly. The first matter Paul brings up: prayer. Prayer is extremely important for this to be the very first matter brought up.

Paul encourages the Church to pray for kings and others in high authority so that they, along with the Church and the others in the land, might lead to peaceful, quiet, godly, and dignified lives. Praying for our national leaders has become a lost priority for the church today, especially for our national leaders. We sometimes either selectively choose to only pray for those national leaders in Government who represent our favorite political party and despise the other, or we just don’t pray at all because we rather debate and embrace divisiveness spit out from either political party and news outlets that feed our cravings. 

However, this is the opposite of what Paul instructs us to do. We MUST pray for the President, Congress, and Senators because prayer is an instrument God graciously will use to compel national leaders in the United States to lead peaceful, quiet, godly, and dignified lives. And we all know this is a revival the United States deeply needs through Jesus Christ.

We must choose to pray for national leaders before gossiping about them as terrible leaders. Yes, to a degree this is very true, but our job in the Church is to pray our national leaders to end up having a heart change. This is hard to say and practice, but it's needed. Imagine if we--the Church did this, together? It's possible. It's needed.

Remember, we beat to a different drum. We pray for those leaders of the Democratic party who are okay with abortion and those leaders of the Republican Party who are racist/xenophobic toward Immigrants and Migrants. Let's pray and spend time with God.”

"The 4th Annual Shield a Badge with Prayer Rally will be held for the first time on September 11th this year. September 11th is a great reminder to all of us on how blessed we are to have the men and women in Ashtabula County that make up our teams of first responders who protect and serve all of our communities!

We hope you will join us on Wednesday, September 11th at the Ashtabula County Peace Officers Memorial in Jefferson behind the old county courthouse starting at 6:30 PM.

This is our opportunity as a community to come together to thank the men and women and their families for all they sacrifice to protect us and to pray for their safety.

We are currently lining up pastors from around Ashtabula County to join us. If your pastor would like to join us and say a few words and lead us in prayer please contact Charlie Frye at 440-858-3554 or email chairman@ashtabulagop.com.

We have already confirmed Pastor Sean Hampton from The Ashtabula First Church of the Nazarene; We will announce Pastors as they confirm.

This year's Prayer Rally master of ceremonies, for his 4th year is Eastern County Court Judge, The Honorable Harold Specht.",2019-08-20T22:35:52+0000,Ashtabula County Republican Party,0,99,0,999,0.974074,Ohio,0.025926,Pennsylvania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
