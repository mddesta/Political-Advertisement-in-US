"Sign the Petition to President Trump! Tell President Trump to ban federal funds from colleges and universities that obstruct enforcement of America's immigration laws.

Radical liberals wall off their campuses from law enforcement officers to stop the arrest and deportation of illegal aliens. On these “sanctuary campuses,” liberals deliberately break the law! 

It’s outrageous that illegal aliens are admitted ahead of citizens and given generous financial aid, while American families are saddled with huge student loans. 

If you believe that immigration laws should be enforced, sign the petition to President Trump -- tell him to ban federal funding for any college or university that violates U.S. immigration law.

"The president of Brazil and the majority of Brazilians that voted for him are clearly irrational.
At the very least, it’s illogical to destroy an entire rainforest for short-term profit maximization, never mind that the burning forests will greatly exacerbate climate change.

Per the latest climate models, the world is on track for 5C (9F) by 2060 with unabated climate change. As a result, the world can 
NO LONGER TOLERATE
incredibly irresponsible and irrational behavior that not only pollutes a vast country like Brazil, but also the entire world and greatly increases the severity of climate change.

We could largely put out the fires, reforest the deforested land and the world’s lungs, 
and compensate the local farmers. 
We could even hire the locals to protect the forest. 
Norway has done something similar in Indonesia, under the Paris Agreement.

TO GET BRAZIL’S ATTENTION, 
the UN or possibly all countries around the world on an informal basis should 
IMMEDIATELY 
BAN ALL TRADE WITH BRAZIL 
AND 
TRAVEL TO BRAZIL, 
AND 
FREEZE 
ALL OF BRAZIL’S 
FINANCIAL ASSETS AROUND THE WORLD.

Subsequently, the world could negotiate custodianship and reforestation of the Amazon rainforest and subsidies to Brazil for their cooperation.
Reforesting all of the rainforest lost to agriculture would go a long way to planting
ONE TRILLION TREES
TO REMOVE 205 BILLION TONS
OF SURPLUS ATMOSPHERIC CO2,
the primary driver of today’s climate change.
...
... “In 2017, Brazil major trading partner countries for exports were China, United States, Argentina, Netherlands and Japan and for imports they were China, United States, Argentina, Germany and Korea.
