"DEMOCRATS’ ANNIHILATION of the ENGLISH LANGUAGE and STANDARD PROSE—as 
DEMOCRAT Elizabeth Warren ISSUES her 163rd PUBLIC ”APOLOGY” for “INDIAN” LIES

TODAY: At a Native American Presidential Forum in Iowa:

     “I know that I have made mistakes. I am 
    sorry for harm I have caused. I have listened 
    and I have learned. A lot. And I am grateful 
    for the many conversations that we have 
    had together. It is a great honor to partner 
    with Indian Country.”

ANALYSIS (for normal English speakers)

▪️”mistake”  [Used incorrectly here. A “mistake” would be to put a first name on an application where a last name is supposed to go, and vice versa. Or to put the state in the blank where the city should go. However, writing that you are an Indian when you are not and never have been is not a “mistake” any more than writing that your age is “37” when you are actually 54. But modern Democrats or Leftists—as Orwell forewarned—use language only as a means of political manipulation.]

▪️”sorry for harm I have caused”   [Yes, to my campaign. Otherwise the “apology” would be direct, like the “old-fashioned” apology: 
     “I am sorry for what I did and for the 
     misrepresentations that I made that 
     accrued to my advantage. I was wrong to 
     take those advantages—and steal from 
     those who actually are Indian.”]

▪️”...listened and...learned”  [Throwaway line. Standard political consultant speech-writing boilerplate.]

▪️”grateful for the many conversations we have had together...”   [About as empty and devoid of meaning as can be strung together. Filler. Attempting to imply it has something to do with owning up to wrongdoing, but without actually admitting anything—the “conversations” could have been about anything.]

▪️”partner with Indian Country.”  [She meant “pander” instead of “partner” — meaning “I’ll say or do anything if you give me a pass for lying about being Cherokee.”

WARREN’s POLLING: NOW 2nd PLACE

We realize that Warren has overtaken U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the polls and—as a wildly enthusiastic media now happily proclaim every few minutes—now trails only Biden.

However, we stand by our assertion, made ten months ago, that Elizabeth Warren will not only not be president, she will not get the nomination. The “fake Indian” story was and is fatal—despite the “Indian Summer” her polling results are currently enjoying.",2019-08-19T22:49:15+0000,NMPJ,0,99,0,999,1,New Mexico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

News for and about Nelson County, Virginia, Democrats

Democrat running for Soil and Water Conservation District

Hello Nelson Democrats,
We have an excellent democrat, Bill Plyler running to represent Nelson County as a director of the Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District.  Below is his statement.  Please read it and support Bill in November.

I appreciate the opportunity to tell you that there is a true blue Democrat running to represent Nelson County as a Director of the Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District.

Please visit and like the Facebook page, Vote Bill Plyler.

Because the Commonwealth treats this as a non-partisan election, it will be necessary to select my name on your ballot in addition to voting your straight Democratic ticket.
 
I was asked to seek election to this office and agreed to do so because it is critical to elect Democrats to every office.

I believe that the Climate Crisis is the major threat to the Earth.  The United States must embrace diversity and solve the immigration issue now.  Health care is a right of all people and will require a single-payer solution separated from employers.  Workers must get a fair share.  A strong economy and freedom require removing dark money and foreign influence from our elections.

If elected I will keep these principals first in all my decisions.

I have demonstrated against and will continue to oppose the ACP.

I have no employer or any special interest group influencing me.

I will attend all meetings and vote your interests.

I will meet with all citizens at their convenience.

I have over 50 years experience and training in clean water and conservation.

Please like ""Vote Bill Plyler"" on Facebook now.  Call me at 434 361 1415 anytime.",2019-08-19T22:04:24+0000,Bill Plyler,0,99,1000,4999,1,Virginia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FAKE INDIAN DEMOCRAT SOCIALIST ELIZABETH WARREN IS A DESPICABLE FRAUD -- SHE'S ONE OF THE 1% IN THE UNITED STATES WORTH $8.75 MILLION IN 2019!!!     WHAT????   IT'S TRUE. WARREN EARNED A GREAT DEAL OF WEALTH AS A LAW PROFESSOR AND AS A POLITICIAN. NOW SHE'S AIMING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BY PANDERING VOTES FROM THE POOREST U.S. CITIZENS AND MINORITIES?  WHAT???

Elizabeth Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, have amassed a formidable financial fortune, placing her well within the 1% of highest-earning Americans.

What Is Elizabeth Warren's Net Worth?

Elizabeth Warren's net worth amounts to a consensus $8.75 million in 2019, a figure that is based on various financial statements, most notably the release of her federal tax returns -- 10 years in total through 2018.

In 2017, for example, Sen. Warren listed an annual growth income of $913,000 (combined with her husband, who is a Harvard University professor). $174,000 of that figure came from her job as a U.S. senator, while $430,000 came from her work as a top-selling author.

In 2018, she listed total household income of $905,742, with $324,687 listed as business income -- again, mostly from her book-writing earnings. Sen. Warren also listed her $175,000 Congressional earnings, along with her husband's $400,000 salary from Harvard University.

Warren spent the early portion of her presidential run apologizing for her claim of Native American ancestry, spotlighted by a DNA test that showed a statistically low level of Native American bloodlines, which at first Warren vigorously defended.

Yet after numerous calls for an apology, one notably from the Cherokee Nation (who deemed the ancestry claim as ""inappropriate and wrong"") Warren apologized in early 2019, and was able to largely put the issue behind her. That said, critics will be sure to resurrect the claim if Warren scores the Democratic presidential nomination in the summer of 2020.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

Sheriff Lee Boan presented an incredible argument as to why they should allow his department to run the County Detention Center, but they ignored him and the facts. These council members seem intent on taxing and spending. In fact, there are six members on Council who claim to be Republicans, yet five of these vote with the only certified Democrat every single time. During the past few years, Sammy Tucker seems to have taken over the entire Council, save Jimmy Jones. Why do these five men seem to be so controlled by Tucker? On every vote, as the Democrat’s hand goes up, so do the hands of Snodgrass, Connell, Bozard, Gardner, and Burns. Why do these men run as Republicans, yet always vote with the only Democrat on council? What does Tucker have on them? Thank you Jimmy Jones for sticking to the Republican Party Platform.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

    MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered https://t.co/gRJZqDmGZ0

    — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"Who’s on First? - Charlie's Soapbox 8/16/19

When I went to grammar school there were kids in my classes who, when election time rolled around, would be for different candidates than I was, or rather their parents were, as we were all way too young to grasp the implications or ramifications of whichever candidates were on the ballot.

In my family, my parents and grandparents - having lived through the Great Depression - whatever candidates who ran in the Democrat side of the ballot were favored, as Roosevelt was hailed as the president who ended the “hard times” as they were commonly known, and Herbert Hoover, whose name was practically synonymous with a curse word, and the Republican Party wore the blame for decades.

My friends and playmates whose families favored the republican candidates simply reflected the thoughts and choices they had heard at home and conversely, the kids from the Democrat homes did the same.

But there was never any animosity, anger or grudges held against opposing sides, a situation akin to whether you were a New York Yankees fan or a Brooklyn Dodgers fan as most of the boys of my acquaintance were in those days of smaller baseball leagues and limited choices.

Politics, for the most part in those days before the coming of television, was more a distraction whose conventions and coverage took up valuable radio time usually devoted to The Lone Ranger and the myriad of afternoon broadcast time slots allotted to programming for the pee-wee set.

Even in high school, we paid more attention to -  but took no umbrage at - each other’s political choices and they affected our relationships not one whit.

I don’t know exactly when we began to be so divided by politics that we feel it is incumbent upon us to totally disrespect the opinions of others as to let it divide friends and family and that, in some circles, verbal disagreement is not enough and we are obliged to harm or even destroy those who disagree with us.

This is not a brand new thing, but has grown in intensity over the last few years, certainly exacerbated by the advent of the twenty-four-hour cable news networks, especially the ones that show political bias, which is practically all of them, mainstream media and radio talk shows notwithstanding.

Our two most recent presidents are probably the most polarizing figures to hold the office in over a century, and both have a sizable contingency of dedicated followers, firmly convinced that there is no middle ground, that it is a winner take all scenario, a never give an inch, ""hooray with our side and to hell with yours"" attitude. Fanned by the hyperbolic and asinine remarks of ambitious politicians who pander to any and all.

This situation, although intolerable now, will surely reach a fever pitch in the coming months of no holds barred campaigning and by the time the actual election rolls around the bloody campaign trail will be littered with the bodies of the “also-rans,” victims of the better-spoken, better-financed, who cared not at all for the voracity of their acidic remarks nor the reputations or permanent damage done to any opponent who dared stand between them and the power they seek.

The truly dangerous part of this national conundrum is the hate it generates, the belief that it is our obligation to despise the “other side”, that their opinions are not even worthy to be heard and should be suppressed and shouted down instead of being fairly aired in the arena of ideas, both sides weighed and evaluated by all voters in the constitutionally mandated process of one person, one vote, to be decided in the privacy of the ballot box and counted in a fair and impartial way.

Where does it end? I honestly don’t know.

But this I do know.

It would serve the nation well for both sides to stick to the issues, dial back the name calling and personal insults, the groundless accusations, the vendettas and the making of promises that are impossible to fulfill.

Is it possible?

Being the optimist that I am, I believe it is.

Once in a while, something happens that pulls us together, that brings home the fact of how precious our country is to us and that no candidate or political party deserves our allegiance as much as our nation does, that we need to find some common ground and stand on it, politics be damned.

I don’t know when, I don’t know how, I don’t know what, but we will, at some time in the future experience such an event and realize just how far we have drifted from God and the principles that made this nation what it is.

We can find the way back, but it leads through repentance and common sense.

“If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” - 2 Chronicles 7:14

What do you think?

Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem. 

God Bless America

"The Truth about Justice Bill Waller: 

First and foremost, Justice Waller actually has a plan to help with some of the biggest issues facing our state.  None of us are going to agree on every single policy detail. The legislature made up of 122 state representatives and 52 state senators will ultimately decide the details. Our other opponent has not presented a single solution to any of our major problems. In fact, he doesn’t even acknowledge the fact that anything needs to be fixed in Mississippi.  It is easy to attack other Conservatives for not being “conservative enough” when they are actually proposing solutions and you are not.  It is much harder to actually stick your neck out and talk about how to fix the issues knowing that it opens you up for criticism.  

 1. Justice Waller, a retired General from the National Guard, supports the 2nd Amendment and is against red flag laws. I have had these conversations with him personally. 
 2. Justice Waller is not against the state flag.  He has stated publicly that he voted for our flag in 2001 and will continue to support the will of the people.
 3. Justice Waller is not a Democrat, he is a Republican.  He ran as required by law as non-partisan for Supreme Court Justice where he moved the needle to make Mississippi’s Supreme Court a more conservative court. Yes, his dad was a Democrat Governor in the 70’s. This was  before Reagan, so almost everyone in the South was a Democrat.  He did recently vote in the Democratic primaries in state elections because in his county (Hinds - where the city of Jackson is located) as with many other counties in Mississippi where all local elected officials are Democrat, if you don’t vote in the Democratic primary you will not have a vote for your sheriff, supervisor, tax accessor, constable, tax collector, coroner, chancery clerk, or any other county official. Republicans do not typically run in these areas controlled by  a Democrat majority. 
 4. He does not support raising taxes.  He is actually proposing a conservative tax SWAP plan to fix our infrastructure problems.  The plan is to cut the personal income tax and replace with a use tax on gas so that everyone who uses the roads and bridges (including tourists and even drug dealers) will pay for the roads they use.  He recognizes that we over-tax the very people we need more of in Mississippi and that they are leaving our state -  the working class, professionals and small business owners. We must look to conservative states such as TN, TX and FL which are growing much faster economically than us and reform our very bad tax structure to be more competitive with theirs. 
 5. He does not support Obamacare expansion like Jim Hood. The Democrats support raising the income threshold and adding more people to 100% government paid healthcare. This is bad policy that Justice Waller is against. With rural hospitals struggling in Mississippi and nearly 300,000 working class Mississippians unable to afford private insurance, reform is needed. His proposal is a conservative approach to Medicaid reform, very similar to what VP Mike Pence did in Indiana with business-minded checks and balances put into place. We should encourage people to work and have “skin in the game” and this is exactly what his proposal would do. 

So, before you believe all of the negative ads and mail-outs, look for the truth.  The only reason our other primary opponent is going negative is because he has no plan of his own to speak of, and because he is scared of losing power.  Career politicians and the special interests who control them with millions of dollars of campaign donations will say and do anything to hold onto power.  Don’t be fooled by them or their bought and paid for endorsements. They have been conning the great people of Mississippi for far too long. It’s time to break the cycle. I ask you to pray before you vote on August 27th and vote your convictions.",2019-08-16T20:40:32+0000,Friends of Robert Foster,500,999,10000,49999,1,Mississippi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We the People are coming to take back Congress! And we’re bringing with us some big ideas like Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.

In 2018, our campaign to replace Speaker Nancy Pelosi as San Francisco's representative in Congress won more votes against the incumbent than any primary challenger from the left in a decade.

Now, we're back to finish the job in 2020. But we can’t do it alone. Taking on the most established Democrat in the country is no small feat and will require a massive grassroots effort to overcome all the corporate cash that will pour into this race.

Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez beat the 4th highest ranking member of the Democratic party and sent a shockwave across the country. Imagine what can happen when we defeat the epicenter of the Democratic Establishment with another champion of the 99%?

"An update on the para­le­gal that stole $81k that worked for Demo­crat Can­di­date for Lackawanna County Commissioner Debi Domenick.

Under the Rules of Professional Conduct governing lawyers, a lawyer is required to supervise employees and ensure that an employee's conduct  is compatible with the professional obligations of that lawyer. The negligent supervision of this paralegal by Atty Domenick was a violation of that rule. The attorney is ultimately responsible for what a paralegal does in the representation of a client. The buck stops with the attorney. 

Giving the paralegal with a history of bad credit and being sued by creditors a power of attorney over a client's bank accounts is extremely poor judgment.  

If you can't properly run  your law office how can the public have confidence that you have the ability to run the county and supervise employees as a Commissioner?

Domenick: Theft case shouldn’t hurt bid for county post

Lack­awanna County com­mis­sioner can­di­date says she “did right thing” by turn­ing in para­le­gal.

The Times-Tribune, USA Aug 16, 2019 A1 BY BO­RYS KRAWCZE­NIUK STAFF WRITER
At­tor­ney Debi Domenick says she quickly re­ported to a de­tec­tive that her then-para­le­gal stole from her and a client and doesn’t think the theft should hurt her bid for Lack­awanna County com­mis­sioner.
Domenick said she also im­me­di­ately fired
Lau­ren C. Brigham, a long­time friend, who be­trayed her trust as she de­fended the client, John Jenk­ins, an ac­cused mur­derer.
“I had to turn in some­body who was very im­por­tant to me,” Domenick said. “I did the right thing.”
On Feb. 12, the day be­fore county Com­mis­sioner Pa­trick O’mal­ley in­tro­duced her as his run­ning mate, Domenick with­drew from de­fend­ing Jenk­ins, ac­cord­ing to a court doc­u­ment. She re­joined his le­gal team July 30 af­ter win­ning a Demo­cratic com­mis­sioner nom­i­na­tion in the May 21 pri­mary elec­tion.
‘I fully co­op­er­ated. I acted in the best in­ter­ests of my client. I acted with due dili­gence . ... This is my ca­reer. Not only did she (Brigham) put my fu­ture at risk but my client’s (fu­ture).’ Debi Domenick
She said she with­drew to spare Jenk­ins the pub­lic­ity a cam­paign for com­mis­sioner might at­tract.
Domenick and Com­mis­sioner Jerry No­tar­i­anni, and not O’mal­ley, won the Demo­cratic nom­i­na­tions. They face Repub­li­cans Chris Cher­mak and Mike Gian­netta in the Nov. 5 elec­tion. Cher­mak and Gian­netta posted a news­pa­per story about Brigham’s ar­rest and Domenick’s role in it on their cam­paign’s Face­book page Aug. 13.
In June, Lack­awanna County De­tec­tive Lisa Bauer charged Brigham, 36, of West Wy­oming, with forgery, theft, writ­ing a bad check and fraud­u­lent use of a check­ing ac­count that Jenk­ins au­tho­rized her to tap only to cover his de­fense costs. Brigham re­moved $81,528 from Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count for her per­sonal use, ac­cord­ing to an ar­rest af­fi­davit. She also forged Domenick’s name on three checks to­tal­ing $30,000. Brigham waived her right to a pre­lim­i­nary hear­ing this week.
Domenick said Brigham, who worked for her per diem for years, blamed men­tal health is­sues for what hap­pened.
“I’ve known Lau­ren for 15 years and she had never given me any rea­son to be­lieve she was any­thing other than trust­wor­thy,” Domenick said.
An ar­rest af­fi­davit says Brigham gained Jenk­ins’ power of at­tor­ney Aug. 30, 2018, two days af­ter his ar­rest for the mur­der of Tammy Fox. Po­lice say Fox — a key wit­ness against sev­eral for­mer Lack­awanna County Prison guards charged with sex­u­ally abus­ing her and other fe­male in­mates — died in a one-car crash last Au­gust near down­town Scran­ton be­cause Jenk­ins cut the car’s brake lines.
Domenick said Jenk­ins met Brigham through her rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Jenk­ins on an ear­lier mat­ter. Jailed with­out bail af­ter the mur­der ar­rest, Jenk­ins asked for ad­vice about pay­ing his le­gal fees.
Domenick said she out­lined the pos­si­bil­i­ties — fam­ily, friends, other lawyers — and Jenk­ins chose to give Brigham his power of at­tor­ney over his check­ing ac­count, Domenick said.
As her para­le­gal, Brigham “had lots of con­tact with my client” and “he felt com­fort­able with her,” Domenick said.
Domenick said she had no con­trol over Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count or his de­ci­sion to give Brigham power of at­tor­ney. Domenick and at­tor­ney Jody Kali­nowski are de­fend­ing Jenk­ins as pri­vate lawyers, not in their roles as pub­lic de­fend­ers.
On Sept. 10, 2018, Brigham wrote three checks for de­fense-re­lated costs — $25,000 to Kali­nowski, $25,000 to Domenick’s law firm and $50,000 de­posited in Domenick’s “in­ter­est on lawyer trust ac­count,” or IOLTA, used to set aside money for fu­ture le­gal costs. None of the three pay­ments are part of the charges against Brigham.
On Nov. 20, 2018, with Jenk­ins still in jail, Brigham be­gan tap­ping his check­ing ac­count to pay her util­ity bills, mort­gage pay­ments and a host of other pur­chases she made, ac­cord­ing to the ar­rest af­fi­davit.
On March 28, Domenick dis­cov­ered three forged checks writ­ten from the IOLTA — $15,000 dated Feb. 4, $10,000 dated Feb. 19 and $5,000 dated March 13.
Brigham wrote each check payable to John Jenk­ins and forged Domenick’s sig­na­ture to re­im­burse Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count, ac­cord­ing to the ar­rest af­fi­davit.
The checks Brigham wrote from Domenick’s IOLTA stretch over more than a month. Domenick said she rec­on­ciles IOLTAS at least monthly, though maybe not ex­actly ev­ery 30 days. She had no rea­son to be­lieve any­one ac­cessed the IOLTA be­cause Jenk­ins’ case was idle, she said.
She con­fronted Brigham and re­ported the theft to her bank, Domenick said.
Brigham wrote a $5,000 check from Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count to re­im­burse the IOLTA, leav­ing the ac­count $25,000 short. Domenick said she de­manded Brigham pro­vide state­ments for Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count, re­minded her of the still miss­ing $25,000 and told her she would re­port the theft to the dis­trict at­tor­ney.
“The next day I came in (to her of­fice) and there was a con­fes­sion on my desk” along with copies of the state­ments, she said.
She turned that over to Bauer, the county de­tec­tive. At her urg­ing, her bank even­tu­ally re­im­bursed the IOLTA, Domenick said.
Brigham also wrote a $25,000 check from Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count for the IOLTA, but later called to say the check would bounce be­cause she emp­tied the check­ing ac­count, ac­cord­ing to the ar­rest af­fi­davit.
“I fully co­op­er­ated,” Domenick said. “I acted in the best in­ter­ests of my client. I acted with due dili­gence . ... This is my ca­reer. Not only did she (Brigham) put my fu­ture at risk but my client’s (fu­ture).”
Cit­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions with her client as con­fi­den­tial, Domenick de­clined to say if she re­turned Jenk­ins’ IOLTA money dur­ing the five months she wasn’t his lawyer or if she and Jenk­ins agreed she would re­sume be­ing his lawyer af­ter the pri­mary elec­tion.
Just be­cause a lawyer no longer rep­re­sents a client, she said, “doesn’t mean you can’t con­tinue to work on some­body’s case,” she said.
Domenick and Kali­nowski re­main Jenk­ins’ lawyers.
“I have no rea­son to doubt what Debi says hap­pened,” Kali­nowski said.
Jenk­ins re­mains in Luzerne County Prison, await­ing trial.
Dis­trict At­tor­ney Mark Pow­ell said he sees Domenick as a crime vic­tim.
“She re­ported it timely and it’s be­ing treated like any other in­ves­ti­ga­tion by our of­fice,” Pow­ell said.

"THEY SAID WHAT?!
Another Installment of Our Popular Feature (for the Week of 8/12/19)

By BSpa Truth Squad - August 15th, 2019

BALLSTON SPA, NEW YORK — It was another “hold my beer” set of moments this week in local politics, as the typically quiet summer political season locally had its rhetoric whip up like a California leather pageant.

Here’s what happened.  Local political operative Keith Lewis, who has run the campaign of folks like Liz Kormos In BSpa (who apparently needs a better name tag since she thinks her name is “A Better BSpa” according to her Facebook page), Eric Connolly in Ballston, and now Zlotnick/Kerr/Isachsen in Milton, decided to create his own “public figure” Facebook page a few weeks ago.  Lewis apparently feels that his multiple reinventions — from HIV+ modeling agency operator, to beauty pageant producer, to leather pageant contestant, to documentary producer, to Provincetown restaurant operator, to now his new political operative role — qualify him as such a “public figure.”  If the wheel was reinvented as many times as he’s reinvented himself, it would be a square again.  On his public figure page this week, Lewis lamented that the Village of Ballston Spa became, in his view, the “Village of Bullies” in some ways because of his involvement in local politics.

Some of the classic statements from Lewis included that “the gay community is diverse but in my experience, usually supportive of each other,” suggesting that other gay men and women in the area should blindly support him despite his name-calling, inconsistent statements, reputation-damaging attempts, and victim-playing ways.  He leaves out that two of his most strident and informed critics are — gay.  He also leaves out that the Village that he apparently views more negatively now is 80% controlled by his party — the Democratic Party.  In fact, that Party attempted to endorse the current Mayor and only non-Democrat on the Board of Trustees, Larry Woolbright.  He also suggests he “lost [his] longstanding idyllic image of Ballston Spa” despite the Village supporting his candidates in the March election.  He forgets to mention his perpetual bluster on Facebook on several pages that led to several people questioning who he was and what his intentions were.  Remember, BSpa Truth Squad asked Milton Councilwoman Barbara Kerr specifically if her campaign is paying Lewis for his services — and she failed to respond.  It is unclear whether Lewis is attempting to parlay his local political operations into a new business to complete his newest reinvention.

With respect to Lewis’s playing of the “gay card,” a local reader anonymously told BSpa Truth Squad, “I don’t care if he’s gay, straight, or neither.  He’s an [expletive deleted] for wrongly attacking people’s reputations — including long-time, beloved figures — and then plays victim when people give him grief for lying and attacking.”  In this case, Lewis not only attacked individuals’ reputations, but he attacked the entire Village’s reputation and then tried to act like he’s open to reconsidering his assessment after “the underbelly [of BSpa] was exposed” to him.  It is very kind of him to hold back his judgment unless he gets his way.  Rest assured, though, Lewis invited readers to “dig a little deeper into the facts” related to him — and who are we to disappoint him?  We’ll be following up with the facts we find soon — there’s a lot to wade through... A LOT.  

This diatribe by him would normally be enough to win him the “They Said What?!” award any other week.  But enter Ellie Dillon, local Democratic Chairwoman who oversaw the Party’s endorsements in BSpa and Milton.  Dillon, who should take pride in the Village after her party won political control over it, decided to embrace Lewis’s attack on BSpa, saying “You can call me Mama anytime!! You are one of the most loyal, kindest people I know!”  

Ellie, really?  If you consider Keith’s diatribe to be a sign of loyalty, you must have a low bar for what constitutes loyalty and kindness.  It’s amazing you want to call such a negative place home — the place YOU CONTROL politically currently.  In other words, Ellie, Lewis’s words are as much a representation of your work as anything.  Maybe you should have taken a step back and rethought embracing an attack on BSpa because this reflects on you as much as anybody.

Instead, Ellie, you win this week’s “They Said What?!” award.

"We must never allow God to be removed from America.
Our forefathers founded our Country on Godly principles, reason, and common sense.
The Democrats of today have none of this.
They no longer love America and seek to destroy everything that is good and right.
They want Government to control every aspect of our lives.
Telling us what we can do and what we must do.

Now is not the time to remain silent.
Now is the time to stand up and bravely face evil and stop this madness that is threatening to take over the United States.----Ronda Peterson

"[BREAKING NEWS] Greg Gianforte is Democrat Mike Cooney’s most likely opponent in the 2020 Montana Governor’s race! And if there’s one thing we know for sure, it’s that we can’t trust Gianforte to put Montanas first. Montanans deserve a leader who will stand up for them, not a loose cannon.

"We the People are coming to take back Congress! And we’re bringing with us some big ideas like Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.

In 2018, our campaign to replace Speaker Nancy Pelosi as San Francisco's representative in Congress won more votes against the incumbent than any primary challenger from the left in a decade.

Now, we're back to finish the job in 2020. But we can’t do it alone. Taking on the most established Democrat in the country is no small feat and will require a massive grassroots effort to overcome all the corporate cash that will pour into this race.

Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez beat the 4th highest ranking member of the Democratic party and sent a shockwave across the country. Imagine what can happen when we defeat the epicenter of the Democratic Establishment with another champion of the 99%?
