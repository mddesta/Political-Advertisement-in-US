"Tell the Democratic presidential candidates: Take the #NoKXL Pledge.
Add your name ==> bit.ly/nokxlpledge

Will you take the NoKXL Pledge? Bernie Sanders Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris Pete Buttigieg Cory Booker Amy Klobuchar Kirsten Gillibrand Julián Castro Beto O'Rourke Jay Inslee Andrew Yang for President 2020 Marianne Williamson Tom Steyer

+  If elected, I pledge to take executive action on Day One to stop any construction on the Keystone XL pipeline — no matter what — and revoke the existing presidential permits issued unilaterally by President Trump for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, sending both projects back to relevant federal agencies to undergo legitimate environmental review and Tribal consultations.

"We are back with a brand new episode. It's called WE THINK WE'RE SO COOL BECAUSE WE HATE 'THE GODFATHER'. It's called that because two of these bastards think THE GODFATHER is a bad movie! WTF? I know, what jack-holes. 
In this episode we also ask the question: What makes you feel uncomfortable? 
We talk funny news stories. Including Joe Biden being a dunce. And an even bigger idiot trying to organize a Straight Pride Parade. 
We talk politics in a segment we call 'Polidiots'. We call ourselves polidiots becaus well, we know nothing about politics. 
And finally we give our entertainment See It and Skip.  We talk The Lion King,  The Boys, Vice, The Godfather ( grrrr ) plus I much more.

"MAKING A CASE FOR JOE BIDEN (updated)

More than just that he polls well against Donald Trump...

And let's start off by saying that that is NOT to be ignored.

Joe Biden has had a consistent edge over the other Democratic candidates in head-to-head polling against Trump. In national surveys going back to last March, Biden kicks Trump's butt, with the average of the most recent polls being a 9 point edge. That number is about +6.5 for Bernie Sanders, +3.6 for Elizabeth Warren, and +3.2 for Kamala Harris. Additionally Biden polls much better  against Trump than other candidates in swing states. Biden is the only Democratic candidate who leads Trump in states like Texas and Arizona.

But right now, let's get past the nitpicking about gaffes and comments Joe Biden made in the early 1970s and let's focus on some things that Biden brings to the table.

In terms of the sheer number of issues Biden influenced during his time in the Obama administration, foreign policy and fiscal issues are among many items in Biden's portfolio. Back in 2010 it was Biden's office that primarily  orchestrated the handover of Iraq to the Iraqis. It is Biden's view of  Afghanistan that, bit by bit, came to dominate thinking inside the 2014 withdrawal plan. On financial reform it was Biden who prodded an  indecisive Obama to embrace Paul Volcker's idea of barring banks from risky trading, according to Austan Goolsbee, formerly the head of  Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Biden also tilted the discussion  in favor of a bailout of the Big Three auto companies, according to Jared Bernstein, Biden's former economic adviser. ""I think he made a  difference in president's thinking,"" Bernstein said. ""He understood the  importance of the auto companies to their communities, and throughout the country.""

Thanks to his decades in the Senate, Biden came  to the job of VP with a deep understanding of the way the federal  government operates, which enabled him to oversee projects that spanned different agencies and different branches. Most importantly, he was in charge of implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act), which was one of the administration’s great unsung successes. It involved a huge amount of  work and coordination, and by every account Biden performed  exceptionally well at it. Just the fact that they managed to distribute  over three-quarters of a trillion dollars without any major scandals of  graft or theft was an extraordinary accomplishment.

Biden led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty. (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) This is a nuclear arms  reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation  with the formal name of Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed on April 8th, 2010  in Prague and, after ratification, entered into force on February 5th,  2011. It is expected to last at least until 2021.

Biden declared his support for marriage equality on national television in 2012 — three days before Barack Obama did. He’s been a champion of LGBTQ  Rights, and made big waves when he said, “It’s going to become a  political liability in the near term for an individual to say, ‘I oppose  gay marriage.’ Mark my words,” in a 2012 interview with the Human  Rights Campaign’s Chad Griffin. His support for the LGBTQ community  continued throughout his vice presidency. Biden officiated a same-sex  wedding at the vice presidential residence in Washington D.C., marrying two longtime White House staffers, BuzzFeed reported.

At the 2016 State of the Union address, Obama announced the establishment of Cancer Moonshot, an initiative led by Biden that would accelerate cancer  research, making more therapies available to more patients, while  improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it in early stages, according to the National Cancer Institute. Moonshot came almost a year after Biden’s son Beau died of brain cancer in May of 2015 at age 46.

Biden's 1994 Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013. The act led to further related developments in the creation  of the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term,  as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual  Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Valerie Jarrett. Biden has a strong stance on sexual assault. For example, Biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, ""you did it ... in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from  happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking."" He has also taken legality into the situation. Biden issued federal guidelines while  presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that  ""No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're in  bed, in a dorm or on the street. No means no even if you said yes at  first and you changed your mind. No means no.""

Biden was selected to head up a special task force on the issue of gun control  after a school shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school. Biden delivered solutions for reducing gun violence across the nation to President Obama in January 2013. He helped craft 19 actions that the  president could take on the issue using his power of executive order  among other recommendations.

Among 2020 presidential candidates, Biden has the longest legislative record on climate change. He pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in U.S. history. His first climate change bill, introduced in 1986, didn't pass in the Senate. But the following year a version of Biden’s legislation survived as an amendment to a State Department funding bill. President Ronald Reagan went on to sign it into law. The upshot of Biden’s Global Climate Protection Act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming. The measure also asked him to make climate change a higher priority item on the U.S.-Soviet agenda. Biden supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States to be a part of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Under Obama, the Recovery Act, implemented by Biden, made the largest single investment in clean energy in history, providing more than $90 billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives to promote job creation and the deployment of low-carbon technologies, and leveraging approximately $150 billion in private and other non-federal capital for clean energy investments.

Joe is skilled at reaching across the aisle to get things done. ""He can sit down in foreign policy or other issues and find a common interest and drive the ideas forward.  Look at what he did with Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond"" in passing the chemical weapons treaty and crime bills, respectively, in the 1990s, his  former chief of staff (and later successor), Ted Kaufman, noted back  then. ""I mean, Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond! You don't get more conservative than that.""

Let's remember Biden's debate  performance in 2012. He faced his Republican counterpart, Representative  Paul Ryan, in the lone 2012 vice presidential debate on October 11th in  Danville, Kentucky. There he made a feisty, emotional defense of the Obama administration's record and energetically attacked the Republican  ticket. This helped the Obama campaign regain momentum after Obama's  first lackluster debate performance.

Biden's most important role within the Obama administration was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that ""The best thing about Joe is  that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think  and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that  is very valuable for me."" Another senior Obama advisor said Biden ""is  always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are  as intellectually honest as possible""

And on and on and on.

Is Joe Biden a perfect human being? Of course not. Who is? But is Biden  an intelligent man who could bring a lot of important experience and skill to the White House at a time when we desperately need to be rid of  Donald Trump? Hell yes. And let's once again emphasize Biden polls very  well against Trump compared to other Democratic candidates who either have far less experience, are too ideologically extreme, or both. I say we need Joe Biden.",2019-08-11T16:31:52+0000,Dave Palermo,0,99,1000,4999,0.784563,Iowa,0.215437,New Hampshire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MORE MAJOR US IMMIGRATION RAIDS LIKELY DESPITE OUTCRY – REPORT -- TRUMP'S DEPORTATIONS ARE ABOUT 1/2 OF OBAMA'S DEPORTATIONS, FALLING FAR BEHIND OBAMAS DEPORTATIONS

White House ordered Ice agents to identify targets across the US, report says, with focus on workplaces

But despite the increased action, the Trump administration’s deportations have not matched those under Barack Obama. In the last fiscal year, Ice removed 250,000 undocumented migrants, compared with 410,000 removed in 2012.

A database maintained by Duke University and the University of Virginia found that just 5 companies have been prosecuted since Trump took office, compared to 88 prosecutions during the Obama administration between 2009 and 2016.

A separate study by Syracuse University found that NO companies were prosecuted for knowingly hiring undocumented workers between April 2018 and March 2019.

Social media lit up with polarizing views in support of, and strongly against the action. Many Democrats condemned the raids and spoke in support of the families hit by them. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said the Ice raids were “evil”. Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke said the raids’ “cruelty knows no bounds”. He was joined by 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden, who said they were aimed at “stoking fear”.

But many Mississippi state legislators expressed their support for Ice’s actions.

Mississippi’s lieutenant governor, Tate Reeves, tweeted: “Glad to see that ICE is working hard to enforce our immigration laws. 680 aliens detained in Mississippi today. We must enforce our laws, for the safety of all Americans.”

In a letter to the attorney general, William Barr, and the acting secretary of homeland security, Kevin McAleenan, this week, leading Democratic members of Congress demanded documents showing whether the companies involved in the Mississippi raids would now face criminal charges or fines.

"Hate crimes based on political ideology. 

The FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity or gender.”

A political ideology is a certain set of principles or doctrines in a social movement composed of a large group of people that explains how society should work, and offers a political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order.

The shootings in El Paso and Dayton have prompted discussions on mass killings, mass shootings, and hate crime. 

The FBI defines a mass killing as any instance in which four or more people are killed, not counting the suspected killer. So if you follow that definition, there have been about 30 shootings in 2019 that qualify as mass killings.

The Gun Violence Archive, an independent organization tracking gun violence, defines a mass shooting as a situation in which four or more people are shot. By this metric there have been about 250 mass shootings in 2019. 

We have looked at data over the last 10 years involving mass shootings and have found 18 instances that qualify as hate crimes based on political ideology. We included 2 standout incidents of hate crimes using weapons other than firearms. Below are these 20 incidents, with a brief summary to start. Please share any other incidents of hate crimes based on political ideology that we may have overlooked. The question is, should we as a society try to reduce hate crimes based on political ideology? And if so, how? Share your views at synthisophy.com!

"MAKING A CASE FOR JOE BIDEN (updated)

More than just that he polls well against Donald Trump...

And let's start off by saying that that is NOT to be ignored.

Joe Biden has had a consistent edge over the other Democratic candidates in head-to-head polling against Trump. In national surveys going back to last March, Biden kicks Trump's butt, with the average of the most recent polls being a 9 point edge. That number is about +6.5 for Bernie Sanders, +3.6 for Elizabeth Warren, and +3.2 for Kamala Harris. Additionally Biden polls much better  against Trump than other candidates in swing states. Biden is the only Democratic candidate who leads Trump in states like Texas and Arizona.

But right now, let's get past the nitpicking about gaffes and comments Joe Biden made in the early 1970s and let's focus on some things that Biden brings to the table.

In terms of the sheer number of issues Biden influenced during his time in the Obama administration, foreign policy and fiscal issues are among many items in Biden's portfolio. Back in 2010 it was Biden's office that primarily  orchestrated the handover of Iraq to the Iraqis. It is Biden's view of  Afghanistan that, bit by bit, came to dominate thinking inside the 2014 withdrawal plan. On financial reform it was Biden who prodded an  indecisive Obama to embrace Paul Volcker's idea of barring banks from risky trading, according to Austan Goolsbee, formerly the head of  Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Biden also tilted the discussion  in favor of a bailout of the Big Three auto companies, according to Jared Bernstein, Biden's former economic adviser. ""I think he made a  difference in president's thinking,"" Bernstein said. ""He understood the  importance of the auto companies to their communities, and throughout the country.""

Thanks to his decades in the Senate, Biden came  to the job of VP with a deep understanding of the way the federal  government operates, which enabled him to oversee projects that spanned different agencies and different branches. Most importantly, he was in charge of implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act), which was one of the administration’s great unsung successes. It involved a huge amount of  work and coordination, and by every account Biden performed  exceptionally well at it. Just the fact that they managed to distribute  over three-quarters of a trillion dollars without any major scandals of  graft or theft was an extraordinary accomplishment.

Biden led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty. (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) This is a nuclear arms  reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation  with the formal name of Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed on April 8th, 2010  in Prague and, after ratification, entered into force on February 5th,  2011. It is expected to last at least until 2021.

Biden declared his support for marriage equality on national television in 2012 — three days before Barack Obama did. He’s been a champion of LGBTQ  Rights, and made big waves when he said, “It’s going to become a  political liability in the near term for an individual to say, ‘I oppose  gay marriage.’ Mark my words,” in a 2012 interview with the Human  Rights Campaign’s Chad Griffin. His support for the LGBTQ community  continued throughout his vice presidency. Biden officiated a same-sex  wedding at the vice presidential residence in Washington D.C., marrying two longtime White House staffers, BuzzFeed reported.

At the 2016 State of the Union address, Obama announced the establishment of Cancer Moonshot, an initiative led by Biden that would accelerate cancer  research, making more therapies available to more patients, while  improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it in early stages, according to the National Cancer Institute. Moonshot came almost a year after Biden’s son Beau died of brain cancer in May of 2015 at age 46.

Biden's 1994 Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013. The act led to further related developments in the creation  of the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term,  as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual  Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Valerie Jarrett. Biden has a strong stance on sexual assault. For example, Biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, ""you did it ... in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from  happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking."" He has also taken legality into the situation. Biden issued federal guidelines while  presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that  ""No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're in  bed, in a dorm or on the street. No means no even if you said yes at  first and you changed your mind. No means no.""

Biden was selected to head up a special task force on the issue of gun control  after a school shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school. Biden delivered solutions for reducing gun violence across the nation to President Obama in January 2013. He helped craft 19 actions that the  president could take on the issue using his power of executive order  among other recommendations.

Among 2020 presidential candidates, Biden has the longest legislative record on climate change. He pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in U.S. history. His first climate change bill, introduced in 1986, didn't pass in the Senate. But the following year a version of Biden’s legislation survived as an amendment to a State Department funding bill. President Ronald Reagan went on to sign it into law. The upshot of Biden’s Global Climate Protection Act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming. The measure also asked him to make climate change a higher priority item on the U.S.-Soviet agenda. Biden supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States to be a part of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Under Obama, the Recovery Act, implemented by Biden, made the largest single investment in clean energy in history, providing more than $90 billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives to promote job creation and the deployment of low-carbon technologies, and leveraging approximately $150 billion in private and other non-federal capital for clean energy investments.

Joe is skilled at reaching across the aisle to get things done. ""He can sit down in foreign policy or other issues and find a common interest and drive the ideas forward.  Look at what he did with Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond"" in passing the chemical weapons treaty and crime bills, respectively, in the 1990s, his  former chief of staff (and later successor), Ted Kaufman, noted back  then. ""I mean, Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond! You don't get more conservative than that.""

Let's remember Biden's debate  performance in 2012. He faced his Republican counterpart, Representative  Paul Ryan, in the lone 2012 vice presidential debate on October 11th in  Danville, Kentucky. There he made a feisty, emotional defense of the Obama administration's record and energetically attacked the Republican  ticket. This helped the Obama campaign regain momentum after Obama's  first lackluster debate performance.

Biden's most important role within the Obama administration was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that ""The best thing about Joe is  that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think  and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that  is very valuable for me."" Another senior Obama advisor said Biden ""is  always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are  as intellectually honest as possible""

And on and on and on.

Is Joe Biden a perfect human being? Of course not. Who is? But is Biden  an intelligent man who could bring a lot of important experience and skill to the White House at a time when we desperately need to be rid of  Donald Trump? Hell yes. And let's once again emphasize Biden polls very  well against Trump compared to other Democratic candidates who either have far less experience, are too ideologically extreme, or both.

"AS ELECTED REPUBLICANS ABANDON THEIR PARTY,
Nebraska State Senator John McCollister joins the growing ranks.

Will Hurd, the only African American Republican in Congress, announced on August 1 that he will not seek reelection. He concluded his resignation, writing:"" I will keep fighting to remind people why I love America: that we are neither Republican nor Democrat nor Independent; We are better than the sum of our parts. The NotWe.org link to his text is: PartyOrCountry.com

When he followed Hurd within only days, ABC reported that John McCollister, ""a Republican for five decades, gained national attention Monday when he blasted party officials for "" enabling white supremacy "" following this weekend's mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, and allowing President Donald Trump to ""hijack"" the GOP platform. He joins a group of elected officials who have either left the GOP or been ostracized by party leaders after publicly criticizing the president and Republicans who support him."" https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/nebraska-gop-calls-state-lawmaker-leave-party-64803636

Newsweek has listed other notable Republicans who have left the party since the arrival of Trump. They include Justin Amash, George Conway, Andy McKean, Tom Nichols, Joe Scarborough, Steve Schmidt, Peter Wehner, and George Will.

Many observers believe that the most reliable polls track real money wagers. Despite the ongoing upheaval in his own party, Trump again became the 2020 election favorite in August when three Democratic candidates, Biden, Harris, and Warren ranked evenly in the betting pools.

Citing disunity among Democratic candidates, Odds Shark, a British online political tote board, reported: ""Trump is concurrently the beneficiary of a Democratic party that appears to, once again, not have an overly strong presidential candidate in place. For the first time in months, Trump is again the odds-on favorite to win the 2020 presidential election.""

The election is more than a year away and the odds are frequently changing. However, one message the August tote board is clearly sending to every Democratic candidate is to place unity ahead of any differences. 'Above all else, our primary goal is to return our Government to the American people. Unlike the Republicans, the Democratic party is not falling into disarray. Each of us will fully support whichever of us may win the nomination. At our very core, we are united.'

"Fox News. 8/6/2019- Last year the president called for both tighter background checks and raising the age limit for gun purchases for 21, and told GOP Sen. Patrick Toomey that he was “afraid of the NRA.”

Trump said he was willing to take the heat, but quietly dropped his proposals after meeting with NRA leaders. He did, however, push his administration to essentially ban bump stocks.

Background checks and even an assault weapons ban are no panacea. But if Trump could forge some kind of bipartisan consensus on this treacherous issue, he will have accomplished something that Obama and Joe Biden, for all their focus on gun control, could not.
Would be awesome if Trump could do it. don't you think?

Your opinion is welcome even on disagreement  should not trigger an insult. We need to break the norm.

"We are facing an epidemic of gun violence in America. It is well past time to take action to protect each and every one of our citizens from this violence. The NRA has far too much influence in our government and has continually prevented the passage of common sense gun reforms that would protect citizens and make our country safer. Joe Biden has taken on the NRA twice - and won. 

Between the assault weapons ban and the Brady background checks bill, Joe Biden has led on these issues since his time in the Senate. He has stood up to the NRA time and time again, and he understands that reinstating the bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines  and establishing universal background checks are only the beginning of what we need to do to protect our citizens.",2019-08-07T00:28:07+0000,Biden for President,0,99,1000,4999,1,New Hampshire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gun violence has become an epidemic. For far too long, the National Rifle Association has held a disproportionate amount of power, leading to gaps in our background check system and weaknesses in our gun safety laws. Despite the expansive power of the NRA, Joe Biden has taken them on - and won - twice.

In the 1990s, Biden successfully led the charge to pass bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as  the Brady  background check system. As president, Joe will continue to take on gun manufacturers, the NRA, and this epidemic of violence and hatred in our country.",2019-08-07T00:28:07+0000,Biden for President,100,499,1000,4999,1,New Hampshire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. Joe Biden knew this in 1994 when he sought to ban these weapons of war, and he knows we must use reinstating these bans as the starting point today. We must stand up to the NRA and gun manufacturers—they don’t own this country. We the people own this country. We can’t allow the NRA to continue to dictate whether we can enact crucial reforms that will save countless lives throughout our country. 

Sign our petition today to end the NRA’s hold on American lives, and let Joe know that you support gun reform for safer schools, workplaces, and public spaces.",2019-08-07T00:28:07+0000,Biden for President,100,499,10000,49999,1,New Hampshire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
