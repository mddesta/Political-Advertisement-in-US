"*What is a RECOVERY COURT?*

It’s all about getting people the help they need and recognizing they can’t get it in a jail cell. 

This kind of special court would be operated through our Mayor’s Court. We would accept individuals charged with low-level, non-violent offenses motivated, in part, by drug addiction or alcoholism, and require they participate in the following:

1. Inpatient or outpatient treatment
2. Twelve-step programming
3. Community Service
4. Job training
5. Random drug screens
6. If appropriate, mental health counseling
7. GED Requirements, where appropriate 

If an offender completes the program successfully, the charges are either dismissed or a conviction expunged. 

If an offender cannot complete a portion of the program, there would be a graduated response system proportional to the violation - but we don’t give up on people. 

*Why should we have a RECOVERY COURT?*

Local control and convenience. The Municipal Courts in Licking and Franklin County have drug court programs and they work well for their participants. For Reynoldsburg residents, it’s hard to get out to Newark and Columbus for their meetings. The disease of addiction is stubborn and it would use any excuse to cause relapse. I’ve seen it. You miss a meeting, you get down, you relapse. By making it easier for travel and parking with local control in these cases, we give people a better opportunity to be successful. 

*Why would I be most qualified candidate to implement a RECOVERY COURT?*

Experience. Real experience. I have worked in the criminal justice system for over 14 years, as a defense attorney, as a prosecutor, and as a judge in Licking County. For several years, I served on the OVI Court Treatment Team in Licking County. 

I’ve worked with specialized dockets and I’ve worked with recovering addicts and alcoholics. I understand the disease. I accept that it is a disease. And I am passionate about approaching this disease in a proactive manner. This isn’t the same non-sense political pandering to me. It’s personal and it’s time we make it personal.",2019-08-18T15:15:31+0000,Shook For Reynoldsburg,0,99,1000,4999,1,Ohio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jonathan's childhood was confusing and filled with strife.  He spent most his life bouncing back and forth between his father and mother, with no stability. 

He shared, “I didn’t feel accepted at home or at school, and the people I felt I could be myself with did drugs.” 

He spent years making bad choices which led to time in jail, where he finally reached a turning point. He didn't want to continue the pain-filled life he had been living, but wasn't sure what to do.

When Jonathan got out of jail, he came to the Mission looking for answers. God spoke to his heart through chapel and interactions with staff.  He started to feel as if perhaps he could find the answers he was looking for here at the Mission.

Jonathan joined the New Life program.  During this program Jonathan found the unconditional love of Father God.  Something he had never had before.  As Jonathan surrendered his life to Christ, he began to learn that there was a different way to life.  One that was far more rewarding than any he had ever known.

Jonathan expressed, “If the mission hadn’t been here, I should by all rights be in prison or dead. Since coming to the Mission, I know that I am worthy of God’s love.” 

Jonathan is now a full-time employee at the Salina Rescue Mission and helps lead our volunteer programs, as well as Street Outreach.

"A BuzzFeed News investigation has found that Erie, State Farm, Farmers, and other giant home and auto insurers around the country have co-opted law enforcement to intimidate and prosecute their own customers — tactics that can help companies boost their profits and avoid paying claims.

Insurance companies provide financial incentives to scores of police departments, prosecutors, and other public agencies to encourage them to focus on insurance fraud, a crime that has traditionally not been a priority for local law enforcement. In some cases, insurance giants even cover the salaries of dedicated prosecutors, detectives, and investigators whose caseloads consist primarily of referrals from those same companies.

The result is that dozens of premium-paying customers across the United States have faced jail for doing nothing more than filing insurance claims for damages to their property. #lagov #lalege

"An update on the para­le­gal that stole $81k that worked for Demo­crat Can­di­date for Lackawanna County Commissioner Debi Domenick.

Under the Rules of Professional Conduct governing lawyers, a lawyer is required to supervise employees and ensure that an employee's conduct  is compatible with the professional obligations of that lawyer. The negligent supervision of this paralegal by Atty Domenick was a violation of that rule. The attorney is ultimately responsible for what a paralegal does in the representation of a client. The buck stops with the attorney. 

Giving the paralegal with a history of bad credit and being sued by creditors a power of attorney over a client's bank accounts is extremely poor judgment.  

If you can't properly run  your law office how can the public have confidence that you have the ability to run the county and supervise employees as a Commissioner?

Domenick: Theft case shouldn’t hurt bid for county post

Lack­awanna County com­mis­sioner can­di­date says she “did right thing” by turn­ing in para­le­gal.

The Times-Tribune, USA Aug 16, 2019 A1 BY BO­RYS KRAWCZE­NIUK STAFF WRITER
At­tor­ney Debi Domenick says she quickly re­ported to a de­tec­tive that her then-para­le­gal stole from her and a client and doesn’t think the theft should hurt her bid for Lack­awanna County com­mis­sioner.
Domenick said she also im­me­di­ately fired
Lau­ren C. Brigham, a long­time friend, who be­trayed her trust as she de­fended the client, John Jenk­ins, an ac­cused mur­derer.
“I had to turn in some­body who was very im­por­tant to me,” Domenick said. “I did the right thing.”
On Feb. 12, the day be­fore county Com­mis­sioner Pa­trick O’mal­ley in­tro­duced her as his run­ning mate, Domenick with­drew from de­fend­ing Jenk­ins, ac­cord­ing to a court doc­u­ment. She re­joined his le­gal team July 30 af­ter win­ning a Demo­cratic com­mis­sioner nom­i­na­tion in the May 21 pri­mary elec­tion.
‘I fully co­op­er­ated. I acted in the best in­ter­ests of my client. I acted with due dili­gence . ... This is my ca­reer. Not only did she (Brigham) put my fu­ture at risk but my client’s (fu­ture).’ Debi Domenick
She said she with­drew to spare Jenk­ins the pub­lic­ity a cam­paign for com­mis­sioner might at­tract.
Domenick and Com­mis­sioner Jerry No­tar­i­anni, and not O’mal­ley, won the Demo­cratic nom­i­na­tions. They face Repub­li­cans Chris Cher­mak and Mike Gian­netta in the Nov. 5 elec­tion. Cher­mak and Gian­netta posted a news­pa­per story about Brigham’s ar­rest and Domenick’s role in it on their cam­paign’s Face­book page Aug. 13.
In June, Lack­awanna County De­tec­tive Lisa Bauer charged Brigham, 36, of West Wy­oming, with forgery, theft, writ­ing a bad check and fraud­u­lent use of a check­ing ac­count that Jenk­ins au­tho­rized her to tap only to cover his de­fense costs. Brigham re­moved $81,528 from Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count for her per­sonal use, ac­cord­ing to an ar­rest af­fi­davit. She also forged Domenick’s name on three checks to­tal­ing $30,000. Brigham waived her right to a pre­lim­i­nary hear­ing this week.
Domenick said Brigham, who worked for her per diem for years, blamed men­tal health is­sues for what hap­pened.
“I’ve known Lau­ren for 15 years and she had never given me any rea­son to be­lieve she was any­thing other than trust­wor­thy,” Domenick said.
An ar­rest af­fi­davit says Brigham gained Jenk­ins’ power of at­tor­ney Aug. 30, 2018, two days af­ter his ar­rest for the mur­der of Tammy Fox. Po­lice say Fox — a key wit­ness against sev­eral for­mer Lack­awanna County Prison guards charged with sex­u­ally abus­ing her and other fe­male in­mates — died in a one-car crash last Au­gust near down­town Scran­ton be­cause Jenk­ins cut the car’s brake lines.
Domenick said Jenk­ins met Brigham through her rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Jenk­ins on an ear­lier mat­ter. Jailed with­out bail af­ter the mur­der ar­rest, Jenk­ins asked for ad­vice about pay­ing his le­gal fees.
Domenick said she out­lined the pos­si­bil­i­ties — fam­ily, friends, other lawyers — and Jenk­ins chose to give Brigham his power of at­tor­ney over his check­ing ac­count, Domenick said.
As her para­le­gal, Brigham “had lots of con­tact with my client” and “he felt com­fort­able with her,” Domenick said.
Domenick said she had no con­trol over Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count or his de­ci­sion to give Brigham power of at­tor­ney. Domenick and at­tor­ney Jody Kali­nowski are de­fend­ing Jenk­ins as pri­vate lawyers, not in their roles as pub­lic de­fend­ers.
On Sept. 10, 2018, Brigham wrote three checks for de­fense-re­lated costs — $25,000 to Kali­nowski, $25,000 to Domenick’s law firm and $50,000 de­posited in Domenick’s “in­ter­est on lawyer trust ac­count,” or IOLTA, used to set aside money for fu­ture le­gal costs. None of the three pay­ments are part of the charges against Brigham.
On Nov. 20, 2018, with Jenk­ins still in jail, Brigham be­gan tap­ping his check­ing ac­count to pay her util­ity bills, mort­gage pay­ments and a host of other pur­chases she made, ac­cord­ing to the ar­rest af­fi­davit.
On March 28, Domenick dis­cov­ered three forged checks writ­ten from the IOLTA — $15,000 dated Feb. 4, $10,000 dated Feb. 19 and $5,000 dated March 13.
Brigham wrote each check payable to John Jenk­ins and forged Domenick’s sig­na­ture to re­im­burse Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count, ac­cord­ing to the ar­rest af­fi­davit.
The checks Brigham wrote from Domenick’s IOLTA stretch over more than a month. Domenick said she rec­on­ciles IOLTAS at least monthly, though maybe not ex­actly ev­ery 30 days. She had no rea­son to be­lieve any­one ac­cessed the IOLTA be­cause Jenk­ins’ case was idle, she said.
She con­fronted Brigham and re­ported the theft to her bank, Domenick said.
Brigham wrote a $5,000 check from Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count to re­im­burse the IOLTA, leav­ing the ac­count $25,000 short. Domenick said she de­manded Brigham pro­vide state­ments for Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count, re­minded her of the still miss­ing $25,000 and told her she would re­port the theft to the dis­trict at­tor­ney.
“The next day I came in (to her of­fice) and there was a con­fes­sion on my desk” along with copies of the state­ments, she said.
She turned that over to Bauer, the county de­tec­tive. At her urg­ing, her bank even­tu­ally re­im­bursed the IOLTA, Domenick said.
Brigham also wrote a $25,000 check from Jenk­ins’ check­ing ac­count for the IOLTA, but later called to say the check would bounce be­cause she emp­tied the check­ing ac­count, ac­cord­ing to the ar­rest af­fi­davit.
“I fully co­op­er­ated,” Domenick said. “I acted in the best in­ter­ests of my client. I acted with due dili­gence . ... This is my ca­reer. Not only did she (Brigham) put my fu­ture at risk but my client’s (fu­ture).”
Cit­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions with her client as con­fi­den­tial, Domenick de­clined to say if she re­turned Jenk­ins’ IOLTA money dur­ing the five months she wasn’t his lawyer or if she and Jenk­ins agreed she would re­sume be­ing his lawyer af­ter the pri­mary elec­tion.
Just be­cause a lawyer no longer rep­re­sents a client, she said, “doesn’t mean you can’t con­tinue to work on some­body’s case,” she said.
Domenick and Kali­nowski re­main Jenk­ins’ lawyers.
“I have no rea­son to doubt what Debi says hap­pened,” Kali­nowski said.
Jenk­ins re­mains in Luzerne County Prison, await­ing trial.
Dis­trict At­tor­ney Mark Pow­ell said he sees Domenick as a crime vic­tim.
“She re­ported it timely and it’s be­ing treated like any other in­ves­ti­ga­tion by our of­fice,” Pow­ell said.

"Three Sovereigns for Sarah: After 300 Years The True Story of the Salem Witch Trials.
This is a true story. Nineteen people were hanged and one old man pressed to death, while hundreds of others suffered in jail cells during the ""witch hysteria"" of 1692. Three Sovereigns For Sarah is the most accurate portrayal yet. Each character you will see actually existed, actually spoke many of the words you will hear. Original transcripts of the trials are woven into the dialogue. All of the costumes, locations, buildings and props offer a rare, authentic glimpse of the late 1600's in America. Each viewing will reveal something new, never before seen. Most important, it is a powerful and moving story about three loving sisters who are accused of witchcraft. The youngest, Sarah Cloyce, tried to clear her sisters' names. In real life Sarah died thinking she had failed - but did she? This is her true story.

"Sentencing defendants is one of the most challenging parts of my job as Housing Court Judge. I hear several thousand criminal cases each year. Some are tickets for issues like high grass. Defendants may pay a fine to resolve those cases. Other charges are for serious, ongoing violations like condemnations. For each day the defendant fails to correct the code violations, I can impose a $1,000 fine, six months in jail, 500 hours of work service, and five years of probation. 

When I sentence defendants, I consider the best way for the property to be brought up to code. Many defendants in Housing Court would have fixed their houses if they had enough money for the repairs. If I fine a defendant who cannot afford to fix the property, then that defendant will have a harder time painting the house or installing a new roof. But for the defendants who have the resources to fix their properties and refuse to do it, I have to consider heavier fines, significant hours of work service, and—in egregious situations—jail.

To have the information I need for the best way to get each property repaired, I assign a Housing Specialist to prepare a pre-sentence report for me. Housing Specialists have extensive experience and training in City codes and property maintenance. They interview the defendant, go to the defendant’s property, and check public records. They also talk with neighbors about how the property affects the neighborhood. 

Once I have the pre-sentence report, I hold a hearing where the defendant can present information to me. Then I sentence the defendant. In most cases, my order includes probation. This is the best way to bring the property up to code and keep it that way. 

In a probation order, I consider issues that may make it harder for the defendant to keep the property code compliant. I may order a defendant to attend Housing Court’s landlord class. I may order the defendant to prepare a property-maintenance plan and allow City inspectors to inspect for all items that need repair. I may order the defendant to enter into a payment plan for delinquent property taxes to keep the property out of tax foreclosure. And I may order the defendant to repay the City for any boarding, demolition, grass-cutting, water, or sewer bills that the defendant owes so that our citizens do not pay the costs for a defendant who did not maintain a property. 

Housing Court Judge is a position that requires extensive experience to serve Cleveland and Bratenahl effectively. My ability to analyze the factors in each criminal case and decide the best sentence comes from nearly 19 years’ experience in code enforcement. 

I am running for re-election so that I can continue using that experience to help rebuild Cleveland’s neighborhoods with all of you. I need your help to do this. Please support my family and me during this campaign. And please vote for me this fall. Early voting starts October 8 and continues through Election Day on November 5, 2019. 

Thank you.

"**Please share - Please speak out - Please speak up - Please be brave for our brutally murdered loved ones - #LWOPstays
**I ask each of you: What is the value of a human life? What is the value of your child’s life? Our sons life was priceless and worth every dime it takes to keep his cold-blooded killer locked up — for life — every single dime! These legislators think our tax dollars shouldn’t be spent on keeping cold blooded killers locked up. They think First Degree Murderers should be our neighbors... How dare they...
**If you Oppose Elimination of Life Without Parole Retroactively for ALL 1074 convicted adult First Degree Murderers in Massachusetts please fight these unconscionable bills. Call or email all the Sponsors (#1+2*) and The Judiciary Commitee members (#3*) and help us shut these bills down! Thank you!

August 12th, 2019 Boston Herald article, (#4*), unfortunately there is no mention of Senator Joe Boncore — Petitioner of Senate Bill S.826 (#1*) — he needs to be called out as well! It is despicable what these legislators have done to the 70,000 plus survivors — the families, the friends, the witnesses — absolutely despicable. Forcing us to relive the murders of our loved ones — over and over and over — when we buried our loved ones it wasn’t the end — it was only the beginning... 

Notorious first-degree murderers have hope — hope that their victims nor the survivors will ever have. Disgusting...

“Notorious first-degree murderers — with legislators working for them — are pushing a Massachusetts bill that would abolish life-without-parole sentences, enraging families and friends who lost loved ones to killers.”
“Lifers led by Dirk Greineder, the Wellesley doctor who murdered his wife in 1999, promoted the concept. First-degree murderers would be retroactively eligible for parole hearings after 25 years under a bill introduced by state Rep. Jay Livingstone (D-Boston).”  
   And Senator Joe Boncore! 
“The Lifers’ Group Inc. at MCI-Norfolk and bill supporters on Beacon Hill argue that inmates can reform after decades, and show they’re deserving of returning to society.”
“Members of the Lifers’ Group recently wrote a model bill with advocates outside the prison, submitting it to Massachusetts legislators who adopted language to abolish life-without-parole.”
“Greineder, the Lifers’ Group vice chairman, helped write the prototype legislation with Nat Harrison and Lloyd Fillion — who are working with the Criminal Justice Policy Coalition on this effort.”

IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THESE KILLERS HAVE CHANGED — THEIR VICTIMS ARE STILL DEAD! The 1074 currently incarcerated adult First Degree Murderers must be held accountable for the brutal vicious killings that they committed and were convicted of by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Judicial Court. 
Permanently— just like their 7000 plus victims.

Greineder has mounted multiple failed appeals and is currently serving a life sentence for the brutal slaying of his wife of 30 years, Mabel, who was stabbed in her neck, head, and chest in a Wellesley park.
This is who our elected legislators are listening to — taking advice from — cold blooded killers...

Shame on the legislators who introduced these bills Senator Joe Boncore @ 617-722-1634 (#1*) and Rep. Jay Livingstone @ 617-722-2013 (#2*), and every single co-sponsor (1+2*). Please continue to call Judiciary members (#3*) and voice your opposition and/or email letters of opposition to James.McCarthy@mahouse.gov he will forward to all 17 members of the committee, hearing is not yet scheduled. Complete list of Judiciary Committee members with all info coming soon, for now all their info can be found via link #3*.

Opposition & Survivors Against Elimination of LWOP in MA. will Say No to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”. 
Because Murder is Inhumane and We Demand Justice for Murder Victims. Permanent justice not temporary justice. The justice that they and their families — the survivors — were guaranteed by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Court! 
Because Convicted First Degree Murderers do not deserve the second chance that they themselves denied to their own victims. 
Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers. Period.

"I want to post some of the ideas I want to implement, if I am elected to the office of District Attorney. I plan to change the culture of the office from ""win at all costs,"" and ""we can never be wrong,"" to ""let's obtain justice with honesty and integrity."" I want to expand diversion programs for first time offenders. Diversion programs take cases out of the court process, that's the diversion part, and put the offenders into programs that are designed to rehabilitate the offender. At the end of the diversion program, the case is dismissed. Currently, pre-trial diversion (PTD) is only available for misdemeanors. I want to expand the program to felonies, because many times first time offenders are one-time offenders, they don't offend again. The current administration requires people who want PTD to waive their right to an expunction, which is inconsistent with the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. I will end that practice, and allow people to obtain an expunction after completing PTD. Another reason for changing PTD is that I want to make this city more employable and able to attract good, high-paying jobs by saddling fewer people with needless convictions.  More people should be able to pass background checks than currently do,  and I want to make that happen. There are other programs, like the Veterans Court Program, that work similarly, and I want people to get their expunctions after completion. 

I want to work with other agencies to move mentally ill people out of the criminal justice system. Too often people with mental illnesses end up in jail because their families don't know what else to do with them, and the system doesn't have an adequate alternative. It's up to all of us in the criminal justice system to work toward alternatives to incarceration for the mentally ill. 

I want to decrease the jail population and lower taxpayer expenses by citing, rather than booking, misdemeanor offenders (except DWIs and Family Violence assaults, we have to book them into jail). Most big counties in Texas have moved toward this practice, and it is not expected to cause an increase in crime.

I want to regain the confidence of the people in their DA's Office by having a Conviction Integrity Unit, to protect against unethical practices in the Office. The new unit will be the beginning of a cultural change at the DA's Office, from win at all costs, to achieving justice with fairness and honesty. 

And I want to end prosecution of low-level marijuana cases, and bring this county in line with all the major counties in Texas. People, especially patients with chronic pain, should not have to worry about seeking relief from their pain by using an alternative to the side-effect laden drugs of the big pharmaceutical companies.

"Sentencing defendants is one of the most challenging parts of my job as Housing Court Judge. I hear several thousand criminal cases each year. Some are tickets for issues like high grass. Defendants may pay a fine to resolve those cases. Other charges are for serious, ongoing violations like condemnations. For each day the defendant fails to correct the code violations, I can impose a $1,000 fine, six months in jail, 500 hours of work service, and five years of probation. 

When I sentence defendants, I consider the best way for the property to be brought up to code. Many defendants in Housing Court would have fixed their houses if they had enough money for the repairs. If I fine a defendant who cannot afford to fix the property, then that defendant will have a harder time painting the house or installing a new roof. But for the defendants who have the resources to fix their properties and refuse to do it, I have to consider heavier fines, significant hours of work service, and—in egregious situations—jail.

To have the information I need for the best way to get each property repaired, I assign a Housing Specialist to prepare a pre-sentence report for me. Housing Specialists have extensive experience and training in City codes and property maintenance. They interview the defendant, go to the defendant’s property, and check public records. They also talk with neighbors about how the property affects the neighborhood. 

Once I have the pre-sentence report, I hold a hearing where the defendant can present information to me. Then I sentence the defendant. In most cases, my order includes probation. This is the best way to bring the property up to code and keep it that way. 

In a probation order, I consider issues that may make it harder for the defendant to keep the property code compliant. I may order a defendant to attend Housing Court’s landlord class. I may order the defendant to prepare a property-maintenance plan and allow City inspectors to inspect for all items that need repair. I may order the defendant to enter into a payment plan for delinquent property taxes to keep the property out of tax foreclosure. And I may order the defendant to repay the City for any boarding, demolition, grass-cutting, water, or sewer bills that the defendant owes so that our citizens do not pay the costs for a defendant who did not maintain a property. 

Housing Court Judge is a position that requires extensive experience to serve Cleveland and Bratenahl effectively. My ability to analyze the factors in each criminal case and decide the best sentence comes from nearly 19 years’ experience in code enforcement. 

I am running for re-election so that I can continue using that experience to help rebuild Cleveland’s neighborhoods with all of you. I need your help to do this. Please support my family and me during this campaign. And please vote for me this fall. Early voting starts October 8 and continues through Election Day on November 5, 2019.

"In 5 States, 1 in 5 Prisoners are Muslims 
Posted: 12 Aug 2019 03:50 AM PDT by Daniel Greenfield
At 1%, Muslims are still a small percentage of the population. But there’s one place in America where they are vastly over-represented. 
State prisons. 

Take Maryland, which has an estimated 70,000 Muslims, making up over 1% of the population. But of Maryland's 18,562 prisoners, 5,084 were Muslims. 

That's 27.4% or over 1 in 4 prisoners. 

It would also mean that 1 out of 13 Muslims in Maryland may have been in a state prison. 

Those are startling numbers, yet they come from Muslim Advocates, an Islamist legal advocacy group. Both MA’s numbers and the number of Muslims in different states may be miscounted, yet these figures raise serious questions about public safety and the toll that immigration is taking on our communities. 

While Maryland’s numbers are some of the worst, MA lists similar figures for Washington D.C. where out of 5,219 prisoners, 1,232 were Muslims, so that once again 1 in 4 prisoners were Muslim. 

D.C. does have one of the largest Muslim populations in the country, numbering between 2 and 3 percent. Even taking the highest estimate, 6.5% of the Muslim population in D.C. was in jail in 2017. 

Muslims make up 1% of the population in Pennsylvania, but 1 in 5 of its prisoners. 

Of the 48,438 prisoners in Pennsylvania, 10,264 were Muslim. That’s 8% of an estimated statewide Muslim population of 128,000, meaning that 1 in 12 Muslims in Pennsylvania were in prison in 2017. 

In 5 states, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, Muslims make up 1 out of 4 or 1 out of 5 prisoners. 

In another 4 states, Wisconsin, Missouri, Delaware, and Arkansas, they make up 1 in 10 prisoners. 

That’s a total of 9 states in which Muslims make up between a quarter and a tenth of state prisoners. 

The MA numbers are incomplete because the Islamist group only includes information from 35 states, but they do point to the scale of the problem of what Muslim Advocates call, “overrepresentation”. 

Overrepresentation may be partially a product of the success of Islamic Dawah or missionary activity in prisons. Islamic prison Dawah has produced many converts and at least some terror plots. And it may serve to explain high Muslim prison numbers in some states, but not necessarily in others. 

Delaware is a fairly small state with a population of under a million and a Muslim population of 10,000. Nevertheless, of its 5,235 prisoners, 516 were Muslims. That’s not only around 1 in 10 of the prison body, but also around 5% or 1 in 20 Muslims of the statewide Muslim population of the First State. 

The Muslim settler population is usually at around 1% in the country and its varying states. But in only two states, South Dakota and Idaho, was the Muslim prison population at 1% or below. 

The overall population, as MA noted in its partial numbers, was 84,882 or 8.9% of prisoners. 

Combine all those Muslim prisoners into a city and you have a population larger than Youngstown. 

The MA report also claims that 12% of federal prisoners are Muslims. (CAIR in the past had claimed that it was only 6%.) The current federal BOP population is 177,619. That would mean over 21,000 prisoners. 

And over 105,000 Muslims are prisoners in state and federal prisons. 

Using Pew’s growth estimate, which projects that the Muslim settler population will reach 8.1 million by 2050 (a severe underestimation of actual growth), that would mean a quarter million Muslim prisoners. 

This is not just an abstract statistic. It’s a compilation of human misery, lives lost, futures taken, a litany of abuse, loss, assault, and the accompanying taxpayer expenditures on trials, prisons and free lawyers. 

The current cost of incarcerating Muslim federal prisoners is taking $670 million a year from taxpayers. 

By 2050, the cost could climb to over $1.5 billion. 

In some states, inmate incarceration costs are much higher than they are in the federal system. In New York, inmate incarceration costs run to $69,355 per inmate. There were 7,838 Muslim prisoners in New York in 2018 at a cost that approaches $550 million. By 2050, New York would also be spending billions. 

Maryland is already spending over $225 million on its Muslim prisoners. Michigan is spending an estimated $265 million. New Jersey is blowing through around $250 million on Muslim inmate costs. 

Texas spends $191 million on its Muslim inmates. Wisconsin is on the hook for $113 million a year. North Carolina taxpayers face a $160 million Muslim inmate bill. Missouri taxpayers shell out some $70 million. In Illinois, it’s up to $180 million. Florida is blowing through $93 million. Georgia spends almost $30 million. And Connecticut is forced to spend over $100 million and Ohio spends $90 million. 

Even tiny Delaware is stuck spending $20 million on its Muslim inmate population. 

Pennsylvania taxpayers have the worst of it and are spending $438 million on Muslim prisoners. 

These numbers however are based on average inmate costs. Muslim inmate costs may be higher due to their special needs and special circumstances. 

Nidal Hassan, the Fort Hood Jihadist who murdered 13 Americans, ran up $548,000 in costs. 

But even these extremely incomplete numbers suggest that the federal cost plus the cost in 15 states approaches $3.5 billion. Assuming average state costs across the total population would mean a $2.8 billion cost to the states. (Although this is an extremely inaccurate means of calculating these figures.) 

But it does mean that by 2050, the nationwide bill for Muslim incarceration would approach $10 billion. 

Estimating the projected increase of Muslim prisoner populations can be tricky, but the rise in Muslim crime documented by the MA report still appears to be disturbing. 

In Colorado, the Muslim share of prisoners doubled between 2010 and 2018. 

In Utah, the number of Muslim prisoners doubled, and in Georgia, they tripled between 2011 and 2018. 

In Michigan, the number of Muslim inmates rose by almost 1,000 even as the general prison population fell by 4,000. 

In Missouri, the number of Muslim prisoners increased by over 800, even as the general population only rose by 600. 

D.C., Indiana, and Minnesota, saw share increases of between a quarter and a third. In Kansas, the Muslim prisoner share rose by a fifth. 

Texas added over 1,500 Muslim inmates even as its overall number of prisoners fell by 10,000. 

These are worrying numbers in an era where crime numbers and arrests have been declining. And they forecast the future of states which have consented to refugee resettlement without calculating the harm and expense that migration will inflict on their people, their children and their future. 

In British prisons, the proportion of Muslim prisoners rose from 8% in 2002 to 16% in 2018. 

As a report to the British parliament noted, aside from Muslims, ""no other religion had a higher proportion of representation in prisons than among the general population."" 

We have begun seeing similar numbers in the United States. 

As the debate over immigration continues, we must ask ourselves difficult questions about the price we are willing to pay to welcome in one particular group without caring about the cost to ourselves. 

How many thousands of lives, how many billions of dollars, are we willing to pay?

The crisis of mass incarceration has hurt millions of people, particularly people of color.

It's time to confront this crisis head on with a nationwide strategy to cut the prison and jail population in half.

"Voting is a fundamental right –– one that shouldn't be taken away. 

Right now, there are racist Jim Crow-era laws in place keeping American citizens who are incarcerated from voting.

These laws were made to disempower people of color, who are disproportionately prosecuted and put in jail.

Denying the right to vote to an entire class of citizens undermines our democracy and makes our society less inclusive. It's time to dismantle these racist laws and make sure EVERY citizen's voice is counted for at the ballot box.
