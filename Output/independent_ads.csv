"Working people cannot wait for someone to solve our problems, we must organize ourselves to fight for power.  Both political parties represent big money, monopoly capital and corporate profit.  Only through unity & struggle to build a Workers Party for Peoples' Democracy, not paper democracy, will we represent our own interests against these enemies of the working class and oppressed peoples.

At the national level, defeating fascist Trump and the white supremacist Republican party is the primary job, but at the local level we must organize and mobilize our communities in independent campaigns, coalitions and united front to fight for more democracy, not less!  This is the only way forward for working people.  No one else will solve our problems for us.

"The City of Hartford pays $4.5 million annually to the private owners of the stadium. They in turn should pay our people a living wage! 

As your next mayor, I will fight to ensure every worker at Dunkin Donuts Park is paid a Living Wage and given the chance to join a union.

Here's what's going wrong:
❌ Bronin has decided that the provisions of Hartford’s Living Wage Ordinance magically do not apply to the workers at Dunkin Donuts Park. That’s ridiculous. 

❌ Additionally, Bronin has failed to staff the Office of Human Relations which is responsible for enforcement of the Living Wage Ordinance—even though the city council reinstated the independent office nearly two years ago. That’s even more ridiculous. 

❌ And shockingly, Bronin was quoted two days ago in the Hartford Courant as being both “pleased” and “satisfied” with the employment situation of Hartford residents at the stadium. That’s unacceptable. 

Here's what we're going to bring back: 
✅ Enforcement of our Living Wage Ordinance! 

Every private entity that gets that much money from Hartford taxpayers should be paying Hartford residents a living wage.

"ANDY TAGGART SPEAKS POTUS (VIDEO): So, yesterday we saw another instance of the media carrying out its own agenda  only this time it was from from Paul Gallo on his SuperTalk Mississippi radio show. I respect Paul, have a good relationship with Paul and have been on his show many times. (And I hope to do so in the future.) He brings much needed discourse to our political process.That said, Republicans like to accuse ""the liberal media"" of bias so isn't it only fair that when that bias shows up in ""conservative media"" they be called out, too? (And you wonder why the approval rating of the media is as low as Congress.) This is from the debate with Andy Taggart and Mark Baker which Ms. Fitch refused to appear in (even though it was re-arranged for her schedule). You get to see it in his own words and from his lips, not some edited 40 character tweet from 3 yrs ago summarized by a radio host. Ronald Reagan's 80/20 rule (voting w/ me 80% of the time as opposed to 100% means you're my friend not my enemy) is well known.  Reasonable people, ie, Mississippi voters, know that you don't see eye-to-eye on everything, even though the media establishment would have you believe otherwise. An Attorney General is required to apply the Constitution and the laws and must use independent judgement in carrying out the job.  Andy Taggart owns that fact.  Any lawyer worth his or her salt will tell you that fact. Why? Because the law, and life, are not black and white (or red and blue); step into a courtroom in our judicial system (set up by our Founders) and you will see this fact. And make no mistake, the AG must have those courtroom skills to represent you, me and every other Mississippian. I have faith, as I am sure Andy Taggart does, that the voters know when they are being played and when they aren't. So, take a look. Make up your own mind.",2019-08-17T13:22:24+0000,Senator Brice Wiggins and/or Committee to Elect Brice Wiggins in accordance with MS elections laws.,0,99,1000,4999,1,Mississippi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Katherine G. Johnson is an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. During her 35-year career at NASA and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks. The space agency noted her ""historical role as one of the first African-American women to work as a NASA scientist"". This year NASA renamed the Independent Verification and Validation Facility (IV&V) in West Virginia the Katherine Johnson IV&V Facility, according to the association. #wcw #womenleaders #womeninhistory #hiddenfigures #spaceexploration #scientist 📸: David Bowman",2019-08-17T01:49:51+0000,World Affairs Council of Tacoma,0,99,0,999,0.00361,California,0.99639,Washington,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The City of Hartford pays $4.5 million annually to the private owners of the stadium. They in turn should pay our people a living wage! 

As your next mayor, I will fight to ensure every worker at Dunkin Donuts Park is paid a Living Wage and given the chance to join a union.

Here's what's going wrong:
❌ Bronin has decided that the provisions of Hartford’s Living Wage Ordinance magically do not apply to the workers at Dunkin Donuts Park. That’s ridiculous. 

❌ Additionally, Bronin has failed to staff the Office of Human Relations which is responsible for enforcement of the Living Wage Ordinance—even though the city council reinstated the independent office nearly two years ago. That’s even more ridiculous. 

❌ And shockingly, Bronin was quoted two days ago in the Hartford Courant as being both “pleased” and “satisfied” with the employment situation of Hartford residents at the stadium. That’s unacceptable. 

Here's what we're going to bring back: 
✅ Enforcement of our Living Wage Ordinance! 

Every private entity that gets that much money from Hartford taxpayers should be paying Hartford residents a living wage. I have a long history of fighting for Hartford residents to earn a fair wage and organize, and I won’t let the objections of wealthy corporate interests stop me from fighting for the right of our residents to build a brighter economic future.",2019-08-16T21:28:36+0000,"Perez for Hartford, Ed Jason Treasurer.

"This morning, I had the privilege of introducing the members of the Scituate Summer Fun Foundation during Senate Session. The foundation was started by four freshmen students at Scituate High School to help raise awareness and resources for families experiencing homelessness on the South Shore.
 
The idea started after these students were asked to focus on a particular issue in town as part of their Community Service Learning class at Scituate High. The students visited a local family shelter, Carolina Hill, and met with the program director, staff, and the families who live there to learn about what they may need for support as they strive to rebuild their lives and become more independent.
 
The Summer Fun Foundation was started and they helped raise $600 to help families in need at the Carolina Hill Shelter. In July, these students went back to visit the shelter to bring the families gift cards, toys, beach towels and sunscreen. I would like to thank Patrick Sullivan, Kiera Reidy, Carly Bolton, and Leiney Smith for truly making a difference in the lives of these families.

"BREAKING — BOYS & GIRLS CLUB ABUSE:  Investigative journalists have just released the most comprehensive report ever on the widespread problem of abuse in the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. This very important piece includes a database of known abuse cases — something the #BGCA has elected not to compile themselves. Crew Janci LLP is very proud of our long history and proven track record representing vulnerable kids who are abused in Boys & Girls Clubs.

From the article: “‘[The Boys and Girls Clubs of America] make statements about all their efforts to protect kids, but also try to take the position that the local clubs are independent entities and they don’t have the ability to control everyone that happens to be at those clubs,” said Oregon-based attorney Peter Janci, who has represented multiple victims of child sex abuse at affiliated clubs. “My view is that if Boys & Girls Club of America wants to present (local) clubs as (being a part of the national organization), they need to do everything within reason to protect kids in all of their clubs.’”

"Today marks the one-year anniversary of a mass-K2-poisoning in a 24-hour period on the New Haven Green. Within days, national media swarmed the Green, hijacked the conversation and used our city to sensationalize the drug overdose epidemic sweeping our country 

Unfortunately, in the immediate aftermath of the K2 poisonings, the City chose a path not based on a full understanding of the problems and a comprehensive approach to solving them.  

I propose a multi-pronged strategy for addressing substance use disorder treatment in New Haven. Check out my opinion piece today in the New Haven Independent.

"Seeking UNDERWRITERS for MAUI CAUSES' 6th Year of WEEKLY TV SHOWS Airing On Akaku Channel 55. 

Any donation is appreciated, however, three sponsorship mentions per show for $1000 during each of our broadcasts that air multiple times each week, are a great opportunity for your company to get positive exposure in our community and to support the Not-For-Profits, Environmental and Progressive Causes our shows bring attention to. We intend to product 12 shows before the end of this year with sponsorship available for $1000 per show. 

As a multi-media production team MAUI CAUSES cost effectively produces and distributes relevant content on many of the complex issues facing Maui today. 

Our island is locked in a hundreds year old stranglehold by plantation powers that never did and still don't serve the greater good. Only the people, standing up for what is right, on issue after issue, against the ""Powers That Be"" can bring the kind of change that Maui needs and deserves.

Maui Causes Episode #93 is a perfect example. The current call for community input to find a solution to the lingering debacle of the Maui Lani lots along Palama Drive is a perfect opportunity to shine a light on the continuing lack of accountability within Maui County Government. 

We believe that Maui's Corporation Counsel Patrick Wong acted illegally is 2011 to hide from the Maui County Council an alternative settlement proposal that was accepted by the Developer to turn the property into affordable housing.

By withholding the alternative proposal, Wong was able to engineer an $11 Million deal brokered through his law school pal. In return, it is believed that Wong received over $1 Million which he claims were gambling winnings but for which he cannot provide tax records to verify.

Wong resigned as Corporation Counsel in disgrace yet his replacement, Moana Luety, continues to pervert the system acting as an independent branch of government that is accountable to no one. 

These are the kind of issues we are bold enough to address on our shows. maui Causes is dedicated to being a positive disruption to the Status Quo, which is desperately needed if Maui is to mature as a modern municipality with appropriate accountability and transparency that has been missing here for so long.",2019-08-15T07:15:39+0000,Maui Causes.

In Riverside County, 1.4 million voters are eligible to register. As of Jan. 2, 958,000 county residents have registered. 
Of the total Riverside County registered voters, 38 percent, or 364,600 voters, have registered as Democrats. The Republican Party has 335,600 (35 Percent) registered voters. We can Make a Change! Or We must Make a Change! We MUST turn Blue!!
As you can see, we have an urgent matter to register to vote and turn our counties BLUE. All energized leaders, mothers, fathers, students are eligible to vote and the community is ESSENTIAL. we plan to relentlessly campaign within our counties in order to hit our mark and we will keep you informed of future events.
It’s unconscionable what Trump has, and continues to do to our Country with the separation of children from their parents. People leaving in fear, massive killing throughout the United States with no accountability, and no solution. I ask you, what in America are we making great again?

(Although my business and all the children’s charities I support occupy my calendar, I am committed to make a change but I cannot do it alone.)
We need your help to get Trump out of office!

In the wise words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “If you fail to act now, history will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.”

Voting is a privilege and silence is Consent. The only way the priorities and concerns of our communities will rise to the top of the nation’s agenda is if our voices are heard. Click here to register: https://registertovote.ca.gov/
We have the freedoms to make change, It’s time to use them!
I will be hosting a lunch with Nancy Pelosi (Speaker of the House), and you can bet that I will make her aware of our county and request her assistance to give us guidance and wisdom on how we can play our part for the successful outcome we all hope and deserve.

These are some of many of my charities I am committed to.
• Sandy’s House DTLA (for runaway Girls in Skidrow)
• Hollenbeck Youth Center East Los Angeles
• Boys and Girls Club Temecula, Murrieta and Lake Elsinore
•  Adopted Children 
• The Lupus Foundation 
• St. Jude Children’s Hospital 
• Children Hospital of Los Angeles 

Progressive, Moderate, Independent, Republican, Democrat, we are all in this together. I cannot do this without you!

Vote Blue No Matter Who!
Love Sandy Piña

"The Department of Education (ED) sent colleges and universities across the country three edicts (in 2001, 2011, and 2014) requiring them to create campus disciplinary systems that lacked basic elements of due process and failed to ensure fundamental fairness. If colleges refused to cooperate with this “rule by letter,” ED threatened to withhold their federal funding. 

NCLA’s client, Dr. Mukund Vengalattore, was an assistant physics professor at Cornell on track for tenure when in 2014 a graduate student falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. At the Department of ED's insistence, Cornell tore down basic protections in its own disciplinary proceedings by adopting a “mere preponderance of the evidence” standard, instead of a ""clear and convincing"" standard for assessing guilt. Dr. Vengalattore was subjected to a biased, discriminatory and fundamentally unfair system that was structured, by the Department, to ensure he would be disciplined.

"""Women of color, especially black women, are potent forces in progressive politics, both in office and as organizers who mobilize voters. It seems that conservatives understand this better than liberals. That’s why it’s important to note that the outcome of the 2020 election will likely depend upon the efforts of independent groups led by women of color — like Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC-Atlanta and the New Virginia Majority Education Fund — that are expert at the nuts and bolts of politicking. 

Check out today's New York Times op-ed on the rising political power of Black women and women of color who data shows consistently lead the way in turnout, mobilization, and engagement at--and beyond--the ballot box.

"I make mistakes. I’m sure if we are honest with ourselves we would agree we all make mistakes. I’m sure that if we are all honest we would admit there have been candidates we’ve supported who have failed us. So, full disclosure: Last mayoral election, I hosted a fundraiser for Sylvester Turner. Like many politicians I’ve supported, he has been a huge disappointment. The city is being driven into a ditch. That’s why I’m running for mayor to clean this city up and make it work for everyone. I’m not a career politician. I’m a fiercely independent-minded Marine who solves problems and knows how to get things done.

"Dear Fox News,

Why are you worried about this? Let me give you the benefit of the doubt, and say I believe you (which is generous considering you questionable reporting). Hillary Clinton was the candidate in 2016, not Bill! Furthermore, your acting as if Trump does not have 24 allegations against him for sexual related assaults, or a p%$#y g$%#$@!g tape. You are aware you are not defending somebody with clean hands....? Lets talk about whats really happening here, you have to talk about the Clintons because thats what gets the base excited, just like talking about the ""invaders"" does, and ""the wall"", which by the way was never really going to happen. It was simply a talking point, a concept invented by Steve Bannon to keep Trump on track during his campaign events when he would talk about the subject of immigration. Furthermore, since you want to keep bringing up the Clintons, seeing as Republicans and Conservatives believe in ""values"", let me ask this.. Why do you attack Hillary Clinton for making the decision to stay with her husband, who had affairs? Isn't deciding to work through hard times, ""in sickness and in health"", what you are supposed to do?? Trump, on the other hand, has been married 3 times, has cheated on all his wives, and with playboy bunnies, and porn stars, AND has 5 children with 3 wives! What kind of ""values"" is that? Let's be honest, if he didn't inherit $400,000,000, and if he was not white, that would qualify for Jerry Springer!

Now, I am the first one to be critical of other news agencies, such as CNN, who talk abut Trump to the point that I want to drive a nail through my skull, and who probably helped Trump get elected because of their non-stop coverage of his antics. And I am the first one to admit Trump plays them like a fiddle and can brilliantly change the news cycle at any given time, and they take the bait. 

But you are going to talk about Bill Clinton? That was 19 years ago! Who cares if Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's plane ""more"" than Trump. Thats like when you have a kid who comes home from robbing a bank, and they say to their parent, ""Mom and Dad, Bill and I (Trump) robbed a bank, but Bill actually robbed it, I just stood there, and then drove the getaway car.""

Seriously. Can we get real here. We are talking about the Presidency, and the country.",2019-08-12T13:19:00+0000,AGayIndependent,0,99,10000,49999,0.165604,California,0.042452,"Washington, District of Columbia",0.093856,Georgia,0.056829,Maryland,0.641259,New York,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I am honored to receive the endorsement from the Long Island Federation of Labor. “On behalf of our executive board and the 250,000 union members on Long Island we are pleased to inform you that we have endorsed your candidacy for Brookhaven Receiver of Taxes. Our support for your campaign is based on your record and your commitment to working families.” - LI Federation of Labor

“As your Receiver of Taxes, I will continue to be a public advocate for Long Island’s Working Families. Brookhaven Town has a tremendous ability to look out for our quality of life and the Middle Class. As a City Attorney and Teamster with Local 237, I saw first hand how unions protected public workers and I saw how Administrations unfairly treated workers to balance budgets. I will stand with our workers to ensure they are treated fairly.

As your Receiver of Taxes, I will be an independent financial watchdog to plainly call out any fraud or waste, I see in our town budget and spending. I will demand a level playing field for all bids so union shop companies have the equal opportunity to compete for town contracts.

I will educate Taxpayers on any Tax Relief Programs that they are eligible for under the law, especially qualified first time homeowners, senior citizens, STAR exemption recipients and veterans. No one should have to pay a penny more than they have to.

I will make sure tax information is readily available in-person and online so you understand your rights as taxpayers on how to grieve, demand better services and monitor any increases in your tax bill or changes in your tax relief programs.

As taxpayers we have rights to demand equal treatment and equal town services (ie roads, drainage, lighting, beautification, parks) and I will personally monitor that our communities are properly allocated resources fairly and not just to select communities.

I will put taxpayers first so all residents are treated fairly and so they feel they are getting a just return of services on the taxes they pay. I ask for your support and vote this November 5th so we can Build a Better Brookhaven Together.” - Dom Pascual",2019-08-12T02:19:01+0000,Dom Pascual,0,99,0,999,1,New York,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"YUBA COUNTY RESIDENTS WEIGH IN ABOUT INDEPENDENT BOARDS

Topline: An overwhelming number of Yuba County residents believe the Board of Supervisors should not sit on the Board of the Yuba Water Agency (YWA). Less than 20% of residents believe the combined boards are good for the County. 

Candidates running in the March 2020 primary should take note - Running on a campaign promise of separating the two boards could be a winning ticket. If elected officials aren’t willing to make changes, County residents should consider a referendum movement.

Findings: Yuba Vision conducted an online survey that asked Yuba County residents several questions about the YWA board make-up. 140 people took the survey and they were screened to confirm they were Yuba County residents. Questions offered multiple choice responses, as well as write-in commentary.

Even though a vast majority of respondents do not believe it’s a good thing to have combined boards, more than 66% did not know that when they vote for a Supervisor they are also voting for a Board Director on the YWA. (Note: Should the County Elections Department do a better job of communicating the dual role in the voter materials?)

Nearly 90% of those who do not believe it’s a good thing to have combined boards cited, “a conflict of interest” as their primary point of concern. Nearly 70% of these same people indicated that the, “lack of independent oversight,” and over 60% selected, “Supervisors are not focusing 100% on County issues,” as reasons for concern. Nearly 60% selected, “Agency money is sometimes used for political reasons.”

For those who believe that having combined Boards is good for Yuba County, nearly 60% selected, “We have better representation,” and “It reduces bureaucracy,” as their primary reasons of support. Nearly 30% believe, “It’s a better use of a Supervisor’s time.”

One of the more interesting findings was that when respondents were told that half of a Supervisor’s salary is paid by YWA (which presumably would mean that half of a Supervisor’s time is spent working for YWA), nearly 30% of respondents who favor a combined board, flip to no longer supporting a combined YWA Board. 

Some of the more interesting commentary:
From a respondent who does not support combined boards - “The question arises, is a candidate running to be a Supervisor or more to be on the YWA Board.” 

From a respondent who supports combined boards - “Anything that reduces the amount of people between a goal and its inception is good. More government means less actual work and more indecisive dithering.” 

From a respondent who flipped away from supporting a combined board: 
“It appears their decisions could possibly be misinterpreted in many different ways based upon who is paying their annual salary.”

The survey ran for a week. While the total sample size is relatively small for quantitative findings, given that the opinion range is quite wide, it does reflect a convincing trend that would more than likely be represented in a larger sample size.",2019-08-11T19:19:56+0000,Yuba Vision,0,99,0,999,1,California,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"What’s Going On With Our Local Media?

The local Baltimore/Maryland media refuses to pick up this story, so we’ll have to take things into our own hands.  Is this story too positive for their taste?

Local man survives life of drug dealing, heroin addiction, life on the streets of Baltimore, homeless, overdoses, heart attacks, rehabs, hospitals, jails and prisons.  After over a decade clean he builds multiple businesses and establishes a movement and non profit in which he devotes his life serving addicts, homeless, children and those in need in Baltimore and Maryland, as well as those affected by disaster across the United States, and assembles multiple trips a year to 3rd world countries to serve the people there.
He has recently written a tell all autobiography which goes into intense raw detail describing his life in addiction in the streets of Baltimore and surrounding communities, and his slow crawl back out of it and into a life of success built from the ground up.  He currently speaks at jails, programs and various addiction related events, and has done extremely well with book sales in the independent market.  He is currently starting on his second book.

These are the kinds of stories that we need to hear!  Why does the news not have any interest in sharing this?  Voice your opinion by commenting/sharing/and reacting to this post!

Let’s let our voice be heard!  If they don’t want to make it news, WE WILL make it news.  Let our voice be heard citizens of Baltimore/Maryland!  Let’s let the media know that we want positivity and change instead of the usual pot stirring, violence and negativity!!

"I am running for DA as an independent because I think that most Rocklanders will agree that: 
1) we’ve seen too much political and institutional CORRUPTION in ROCKLAND, 
2) what is happening in the Town of RAMAPO is UNSUSTAINABLE (e.g., unabated zoning, building & fire code violations; Medicaid abuse; RLUIPA lawsuits), and 
3) political cronyism and the BLOC VOTING (as opposed to individual voter decision-making) threatens Rockland’s governance and its future.   
Because of the above 3 factors, the voters’ ballot for District Attorney this year is basically this:
CHOOSE ONE: 
 Democrat/Liberal:                   WALSH
 Republican/Conservative:        WALSH
 Ultra-Orthodox Bloc:                  WALSH
 independent/Serve Rockland:     DIEDERICH
   Why is Mr. Walsh on the Democratic, Republican and Conservative lines?  He is not an incumbent.  He has no experience prosecuting or defending any criminal law case.  It appears that he has obtained the two major party lines through back room deal-making.  This is not proper.  It betrays the voters. 
   Come Election Day, if Rockland’s voters keep their heads glued to Fox News or CNN, and vote straight party lines, Mr. Walsh will win in a landslide.  On the other hand, if Rockland’s voters recognize that this year the election has been rigged against them, and that the County’s future is at stake, they will elect me.  
   An independent District Attorney is what Rockland needs.  So please help me spread the word.  Please put a sign on your lawn:  “Serve Rockland – Diederich for DA”",2019-08-09T20:38:09+0000,Mike Diederich,0,99,0,999,1,New York,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The axe of political retribution has begun to swing.

To be an Independent candidate for mayor, I had to obtain at least 288 signatures from voters in Terre Haute who support my right to be on the ballot. The signing of this petition did not indicate an individual’s support of my candidacy, only that the person agreed with my right to be a candidate. 

Citizens from all along the political spectrum signed my petition. Among them were people involved with the Democratic party, the Republican party, Independents, Libertarians, and everything in between. 

Earlier this week, several people from the Democratic party received the letter pictured below.
  
To those of you facing this persecution from your party:  I appreciate your courage to sign my petition. I realize some of you may not even intend to vote for me, and that’s ok. Thank you for standing up for my right as a U.S. citizen to run for office without having to join a political party.

To my supporters:  Thank you for supporting me--of your own free will. I’m grateful that so many of you are behind me, not because a political party is requiring you to be, but because you believe supporting me is the best way to move our community forward.

This act of political retribution is a prime example of why I’m running as an Independent. “Politics as usual” in Terre Haute needs to cease.

"TOO LATE FOR GENUINE REPUBLICANS TO RESTORE THE GOP?
Until he announced his 2015 presidential candidacy, during the 21st century Trump had spent 97 months as a registered Democrat and only 37 months as a Republican. For Republicans now considering alternatives, the NotWe.org links are:
* To Trump's self-serving political résumé - FakeRepublican.com?
* Republicans who've rejected Trumpism - PartyRepublicans.com!
* Take the Democratic Coalition straw poll - PartyDemocrats.com

Wikipedia reports that ""in 1999, Trump changed his party affiliation to the Independence Party of New York. In August 2001, Trump changed his party affiliation to Democratic. In September 2009, Trump changed his party affiliation back to the Republican Party. In December 2011, Trump changed to ""no party affiliation"" (independent). In April 2012, Trump again returned to the Republican Party.""

Nixon, a Republican, established the Environmental Protection Agency. George H. W. Bush embraced climate science and in 1988 he campaigned on protecting Americans from its dangers. Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord.

Republicans have long championed free trade. Trump has instituted trade wars and imposed crippling tariffs which appear to have driven America to the brink of an almost inevitable recession if he is elected to a second term.

Fiscally conservative Republicans, especially the Tea Party, have long argued against increasing the national debt. In less than 3 years Trump has spearheaded a four trillion dollar shortfall, by far the largest in history.

Traditionally, Republicans hold the office of the presidency in high esteem. In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats gained 41 more seats than the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections. Thus is it any surprise that 2020 candidates and voters, alike, are becoming increasingly wary of Trumpian association?

"Hate crimes based on political ideology. 

The FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity or gender.”

A political ideology is a certain set of principles or doctrines in a social movement composed of a large group of people that explains how society should work, and offers a political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order.

The shootings in El Paso and Dayton have prompted discussions on mass killings, mass shootings, and hate crime. 

The FBI defines a mass killing as any instance in which four or more people are killed, not counting the suspected killer. So if you follow that definition, there have been about 30 shootings in 2019 that qualify as mass killings.

The Gun Violence Archive, an independent organization tracking gun violence, defines a mass shooting as a situation in which four or more people are shot. By this metric there have been about 250 mass shootings in 2019. 

We have looked at data over the last 10 years involving mass shootings and have found 18 instances that qualify as hate crimes based on political ideology. We included 2 standout incidents of hate crimes using weapons other than firearms. Below are these 20 incidents, with a brief summary to start. Please share any other incidents of hate crimes based on political ideology that we may have overlooked. The question is, should we as a society try to reduce hate crimes based on political ideology? And if so, how? Share your views at synthisophy.com!

White Supremacist: 4
Terrorist: 3
Anti-Semitic: 3

Anti-Democrat: 2
Neither Anti-Rep or Anti-Dem: 1
