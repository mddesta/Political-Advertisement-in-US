The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and A Cappella Books welcome United States Senator Doug Jones, who will discuss and sign copies of his new book, BENDING TOWARD JUSTICE: THE BIRMINGHAM CHURCH BOMBING THAT CHANGED THE COURSE OF CIVIL RIGHTS. BENDING TOWARDS JUSTICE the story of the decades-long fight to bring justice to the victims of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, culminating in Sen. Doug Jones' prosecution of the last living bombers. 

 There will be two components to the evening.

1. Meet & Greet with Sen. Jones at JavaVino from 5:30-6:30 PM - If you join The Choir, at any level, between now and March 22, you will be our guest at this reception. At the meet & greet, you will have the opportunity to meet Senator Jones, have him sign your book, and have your picture taken with him. BENDING TOWARD JUSTICE will be the first purchase out of your new Choir account, and we will have your book at the reception.
All existing Choir members are eligible to sign up for the meet & greet with Senator Jones. However, you must call A Cappella Books at 404.681.5128 to RSVP.

This reception is limited to the first 50 people who join the Choir or to existing Choir members who call to RSVP. New members can sign up on our website here:
https://www.acappellabooks.com/join-choir.php

2. Carter Presidential Library Event - The event is free of charge, but seating is extremely limited. You may guarantee a seat (or two) with the purchase of one copy of BENDING TOWARD JUSTICE. This allows us to gauge attendance beforehand; if we sell out before the event, we will say so on our website and social media. Otherwise, you are welcome to come that evening and take your chance on getting a seat in either the auditorium or in the overflow rooms. Again, the only way to guarantee a seat at the Carter Library is to buy a copy of the book. You can do this by visiting the event web page here or avoid the fees by coming to the store to reserve your seat.
Books will be handed out at the event, and we will have additional copies for sale both before and after Senator Jones speaks.

If you are unable to attend the event, you may pre-order a signed copy of the book here:

ABOUT THE BOOK:
On September 15, 1963, the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama was bombed. The blast killed four young girls and injured twenty-two others. The FBI suspected four particularly radical Ku Klux Klan members. Yet due to reluctant witnesses, a lack of physical evidence, and pervasive racial prejudice the case was closed without any indictments. But as Martin Luther King, Jr. famously expressed it, ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" Years later, Alabama Attorney General William Baxley reopened the case, ultimately convicting one of the bombers in 1977. Another suspect passed away in 1994, and US Attorney Doug Jones tried and convicted the final two in 2001 and 2002, representing the correction of an outrageous miscarriage of justice nearly forty years in the making. Jones himself went on to win election as Alabama’s first Democratic Senator since 1992 in a dramatic race against Republican challenger Roy Moore.

BENDING TOWARD JUSTICE is a dramatic and compulsively readable account of a key moment in our long national struggle for equality, related by an author who played a major role in these events. A distinguished work of legal and personal history, the book is destined to take its place as a canonical civil rights history.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
Doug Jones is a US Senator who has made finding common ground a hallmark of his tenure. In 2017, he became the first Democrat to win a Senate election in Alabama since 1992. As U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama from 1997 to 2001, Jones prosecuted two former Ku Klux Klan members for their roles in the racially-motivated 1963 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing that took the lives of four girls. He also secured an indictment against Centennial Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph.",2019-02-26T23:27:38+0000,A Cappella Books,0,99,1000,4999,1,Georgia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"INSTALL NEW KLAN AT SMYRNA

Nashville Banner, Feb. 1, 1919

“Deputy Majestic Soveren Robert Aldred, Sr., of the Soveren Klan of the World, Columbian Union, of Nashville Klan No. 1, conferred the degree of the mask on a class of fifty of the best citizens of Smyrna, Tenn., on the night of January 30.  Many enthusiastic speeches were made. …”

The Soveren Klan was founded and headquartered in Nashville in July 1917. The group billed itself as a “benevolent order” of “oath-bound secrecy” created to promote patriotism, respect for the flag, and “the preservation of the purity of the white race,” according to articles in the Nashville Tennessean.

However, this resurgence of a KKK-like organization did not go unrecognized for what it was. The following excerpts are from a letter by J.A. Jones, an elder of the A.M.E. church in Nashville, that appeared in the Nashville Tennessean in January 1919:

“… The Chattanooga Times of December 13 gives an account of the new birth of this organization, stating that the purpose of the promoters is to maintain ‘white supremacy’ and to perpetuate the ideas of the Ku Klux Klan of other days. It is further said that the organizers anticipate racial disturbances, following the demobilization of the negro soldiers on their return home [from World War I] to civil life. It is thought that such an organization is necessary in order to keep the negro ‘in his place.’ …
 
“Grant that is true: why should negroes be terrorized any more than other people? Why may not the negro live in peace in the country he has fought and died to save and to make a safe place to live in? Is not that what Mr. [President Woodrow] Wilson told him to do when he sent him to the battle front? And must the loyal, patriotic black boy come back home to the land he loves so well, only to be met by the Ku Klux (under another name), to be harassed and terrorized, simply because he is black?…”

Planet editor John Mitchell observed: “It is a significant fact that the emblem adopted is that of the Ku Klux Klan which is so prominently in evidence in [the 1905 book] The Clansman and in [the 1915 movie based on the book] The Birth of a Nation, both of which productions have done more to arouse racial hatred than any similar works in one hundred years. The tendency of this kind of agitation has been known to cause colored people to secure firearms and white people to carefully guard the heavy supply they already had.” (Image: newspapers.com)

"Many new disturbing images of white men, namely elected officials, wearing blackface are surfacing. Blackface is a form of mockery that aims to poke fun at African Americans. A young Republican state legislator in Florida, Virginia’s governor Ralph Northam, and many others have had resurfacing photos of them in blackface. One of the most disturbing pictures depict two men dressed in a Ku Klux Klan uniform, and a third wearing blackface, with a noose around his neck.

Pundits, how deeply rooted in our society is racism? Have we really gone far enough in our nation’s quest for equality, or is this taking a step backwards?

"""Black Virginia voters feel betrayed, left in no-win scenario

By ERRIN HAINES WHACK, February 10, 2019

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Eva Siakam’s choice to campaign for Ralph Northam in 2017 was a simple one: He was a Democrat and endorsed by Barack Obama, America’s first black president.

But sitting in a stylist’s chair at Supreme Hair Styling Boutique in Richmond on Friday, she shook her head in disgust when asked about revelations that Northam wore blackface 35 years ago.

“I really believed in him,” said Siakam, a 28-year-old student. “To find out that he dressed up in blackface is disappointing. He’s shown his disdain for black people.”

Black voters who factored prominently in the 2017 election that helped Northam become Virginia governor are feeling betrayed over the scandalsthat have engulfed the state over the past week, leaving them with a less-than-ideal set of choices at the top of the Democratic Party: a governor and attorney general who wore blackface and a lieutenant governor who stands accused by two women of sexual assault. The next person in line for governor is a conservative Republican.

Many are struggling to come to grips with a list of nagging questions: Do they forgive the Democrats, keep Republicans out of power and demand the governor get serious about racism? Should Northam step down and hand the office to African-American Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who faces sexual assault allegations? Or should all three of them walk away and let principle prevail, even if the other party takes charge?

The dilemma was being weighed in black barber shops, salons, restaurants and living rooms and in activist and political circles across the state in the midst of a still-unfolding reckoning around race and scandal in the Old Dominion.

“We don’t even know where to take the conversation from here,” community organizer Chelsea Wise said at a meeting of Democrats in Richmond on Thursday. “Do we want to address all of them, or are we just sticking with Ralph right now? The fact that it’s all of our top leadership shows that we need to take a hard look at the Virginia Democratic Party as well.”

The governor has been facing calls to resign ever since a photo emerged from his medical school yearbook page in 1984 that showed someone in blackface next to a person wearing a Ku Klux Klan robe. He initially said he was in the photo, then denied that but said he did wear blackface when he impersonated Michael Jackson around the same time. Days later, Fairfax was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2004, and Attorney General Mark Herring came forward to admit that he, too, wore blackface in the 1980s.
As of Friday night, Northam informed his Cabinet that he was determined to stay in office, Herring remained in a wait-and-see posture, and Fairfax had denied a second accusation of sexual assault, this one from a classmate at Duke University who said he raped her in 2000. Northam is vowing to start an honest conversation on race to begin to heal Virginia’s lingering racial legacy.

Siakam said she thinks Northam should resign, but said the conversation must now turn to the larger impacts of racism on communities of color.

“There’s nothing you can do for us to forget, but we should focus more now on structural racism,” she said.

African-Americans, who make up 20 percent of Virginia voters, overwhelmingly supported the commonwealth’s top three Democrats in 2017, in large part as a repudiation of what they saw as the racist rhetoric and policies prevalent in the 2016 presidential campaign and the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville just months before the election. 

Both Northam and Herring campaigned heavily in black areas, and were given entree into many communities by local officials, faith leaders, business owners and regular citizens.
Wise said she had reservations about Northam’s commitment to black communities during the election, but supported him anyway and was prepared to hold him accountable amid a racially divided national climate.

“We knew Trump had just gotten elected and we needed a Democratic governor in Virginia, especially because of the importance of the state in national elections,” Wise, 34, explained. “I almost felt like I couldn’t question him because of the urgency add the importance of what we just had on the national level.”

Wise said she felt betrayed by Northam’s revelations, particularly because he remained silent about his own past after the events of Charlottesville.

“How in the world did you not come out and do your own truth-telling?” she said. “That makes me recognize that you don’t have the insight and emotional capacity to take on what we need in Virginia at this time.”

Shemicia Bowen campaigned for Democrats up and down the ticket. The 44-year-old Richmond resident said she gasped when she learned the governor had worn blackface 35 years ago. She finds Herring’s revelations were even more alarming because he’s the state’s top lawyer and has to deal with daily decisions affecting black people in the criminal justice system.

Still, Bowen struggles with the way forward for black Virginians. She doesn’t think anyone will step down, and as a loyal Democrat, she’s not sure they should turn over the state to Republicans.

“We can’t just throw the whole ticket away at this point,” said Bowen. “But we have to understand that blackface is a blatant form of disrespect. If an elected official isn’t aware of that, what else are they not aware of? What else do you feel like is not a big deal? How are you able to effectively be a voice for every person?”

Norfolk native Joe Dillard said Northam should resign, and that the allegations against Fairfax should be investigated before discussing what consequences he should face. But the idea of a Republican governor should all three step aside was not unpalatable if it’s the right decision, he said.
“Do I think I should support Democrats to the point where I allow certain things that my great-grandparents would slap me in the face for letting slide? No, I won’t,” Dillard said. “I am not a Democrat before I’m an African-American man. For me, it’s always people over party.”

Dillard and Bowen, both members of a group of young blacks active in Virginia politics, said Northam should immediately allocate at least $20 million to the state’s historically black colleges and universities, which have been underfunded. Dillard also suggested an African-American liaison in the governor’s office, to establish a pipeline for young blacks to rise to meaningful positions in government. Wise is already looking ahead to future cycles, where she feels more black women in leadership would help restore her confidence in the party.""

"#BHM Post #2 - Alice Walker (Putnam County, Georgia) is an American novelist, short story writer, poet, and activist. An avowed feminist, Walker coined the term ""womanist"" to mean ""A black feminist or feminist of color"" in 1983.

In 1965, Walker met Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal, a Jewish civil rights lawyer. They were married in New York in 1967. Later that year the couple relocated to Jackson, Mississippi, becoming the first legally married interracial couple in Mississippi. They were harassed and threatened by whites, including the Ku Klux Klan. The couple had a daughter, Rebecca, in 1969 and divorced in 1976.
 
Her most famous novel, “The Color Purple” (1983), won a National Book Award and made Walker the first African-American woman to receive a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In 1985, the novel was made into a movie directed by Steven Allan Spielberg, starring Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover. The film earned 11 Oscar nominations. In 2005, “The Color Purple” was adapted as a Broadway musical, with Winfrey as the lead financial backer.

In the mid-1990s, Walker had a romance with singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, saying: ""It was delicious and lovely and wonderful, and I totally enjoyed it and I was completely in love with her but it was not anybody's business but ours."" When asked about her sexuality Walker stated “I'm not lesbian; I'm not bisexual; I'm not straight. I'm just curious.”

"“Her Prerogative” -by Robin Morgan

For the first time in the history of the Republic, a Speaker of the United States House of Representatives barred a President of the United States from entering the House. 

In 1986, Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill refused to let President Reagan address the House before it voted on an aid package for the Contras, right-wing Nicaraguan rebels for whom Reagan hoped to persuade Congress to appropriate $100 million.  O’Neil offered a joint session with the Senate instead, but Reagan turned it down because he wanted to focus on the purse strings of the House. That’s the only time anything has happened remotely like what we’ve just witnessed.

It’s worth repeating: For the first time in the history of the Republic, a Speaker of the United States House of Representatives barred a President of the United States from entering the House.

This is completely within the rights of the Speaker’s power, since the Constitution specifies that no president may set foot on either the House or Senate floors without a concurring resolution from both chambers. Remember that the Speaker is the most powerful post in Congress, directly in succession to the presidency after the vice president. Nor is it coincidental that the Constitution established the House (Article I Number II), even before the Senate, as the primary legislative body of the land.

So you might reasonably think that my colleagues in the media might report this occasion—the first time a Speaker locks out a President and dangles a future invitation as a strategic carrot—would be treated by my colleagues in the media as the successful, historic event it is. Yet the confrontation has been described as a “petty scuffle,” a “kerfuffle,” a “tit for tat ego squabble,” and a “toe to toe scrap.” 

Gee, I wonder why.

Let’s recap briefly. In the saga of whether and where Trump would deliver the State of the Union address during his own shutdown of most government functions,  Pelosi had courteously suggested he not deliver the speech in the House, citing such sensible (and face-saving for him) reasons as security forces being decimated during the shutdown, and diplomatically leaving unspoken long-term reasons like Listen, buddy, the House of Representatives is now speaking for the people again and refuses to let you throw a tantrum whenever you don’t get what you want in the future by closing down the United States.

Trump, whose approval rating dropped another 10 points in the last month to around 33 percent, decided to defy her. He tweeted that he would deliver the address as planned, “on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!”  

(Wait. What? On location? Does he think the Oval Office is a movie set so if he speaks elsewhere he’s on “location”?)  

Pelosi was utterly unmoved. Trump, still unwelcome, began muttering to reporters,”We will do something in the alternative.” There you go! Forget the Constitution and all that stuff about a President having to report to Congress, the Judiciary, and the nation once a year as to what the Executive branch has been doing (sort of an annual job review). Oh, no, Trump would stage a rally instead, where his dwindling number of fans could buy hats and cheer his racist, sexist comments! Yes, he would, so there, take that, even if he had to hold the State of the Union in a Walmart parking lot!

He dared Pelosi to literally bar him from the House. Pelosi (probably yawning delicately, like a bored cat) replied with a cool “I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when the government has been opened.” He blustered. He ranted and raved. He pounded things. Finally, she made it flatly, icily clear that she would not entertain a concurring resolution with the Senate to lift the rule that a president must be invited by both houses before he can enter either one. Doubtless, Trump had never heard of a concurring resolution—but neither did he want to be met by a locked door with the lights turned out. 

Everyone in Washington had talked about how a bully caves when someone actually stands up to him, but Democrats lacked the clout and Republicans the spine to do so. Then came the midterm elections—with their consequences. And in the dark of Wednesday night, using an almost civil tone, Trump tweeted total defeat. He surrendered. Gave in. Lost. He would postpone the speech until the shutdown was lifted, and he acknowledged that it was within the Speaker’s prerogative to make him do so. Well, well, well.

In her prerogative. 

It was in her prerogative when each of all the women he pursued had turned him down, only to have him assault them anyway. It is in the prerogative of refugees and immigrants to seek asylum. It is in the prerogative of the American people to hold fair and free elections and not to be held hostage for a vanity project wall.

Hard-right pundits mourned that Pelosi had ”emasculated” Trump. Pelosi applied even more pressure, responding to him that she hoped to invite him soon, as she hoped he would end the shutdown soon by supporting the Democrats’ bill that offers to negotiate, plus money for border security. But. None. For. His. Wall.

Which is basically what he did two days later.

Trump became (his own term:) a loser. Pelosi won. 

 She won a rescue for the nation to begin recovering from his disastrous shutdown. She won against sexist troglodytes who still sneer that women lack the toughness of spirit to be real leaders. She won against the juvenile sniping of some newbie members in her own caucus who had dismissed her as too old or too “establishment” to demonstrate worthiness of leading their radical inexperience. Most important, she won by modeling for everyone how to reinstate the crucial, co-equal powers of the three government branches. (Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts, take note: with work, you too could become a profile in courage.)

Does the above battle sound like a kerfuffle or a spat to you? Would anyone dare characterize it as such had both parties been men? Oh no, headlines would have blared Titanic Duel! Mano a Mano! Speaker Wins Historic Triumph!

Now. What follows below may seem like a lateral leap to a different subject, but it’s not. Read on and you’ll see. 

Last week, the nation observed Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. I remember the long struggle to make it a national holiday, and I’m deeply glad we prevailed. But let’s fill in some background. 

Fifty years ago, Daisy Bates, head of the Little Rock, Arkansas, NAACP chapter, had helped recruit nine black teenagers and escort them through violent white mobs into their first classes. Bates lost her vision, was jailed, threatened with death, and survived the Ku Klux Klan burning an 8-foot cross on her lawn. Naturally, she was invited to the famous 1963 March on Washington, when Dr. King delivered his “I have a dream” speech. 

But Bates had to march with the wives of male leaders. 

Rosa Parks was invited too, and Pauli Murray, the feminist lawyer who staged the first sit-in at a Washington restaurant, back during World War II. They also had to walk with the wives—and stay away from photographers. Murray said later, “Not a single woman was invited to make one of the major speeches or to join the delegation of leaders who went to the White House. The omission was deliberate.”

Dorothy Height, President of the National Council of Negro women (who was frequently cropped from photos of organizational leaders), pleaded with King to include at least a token woman among the speakers, nominating Diane Nash, the student leader who was perhaps the person most responsible for the success of the Freedom Riders in the South. But as Height later wrote, ”Nothing that women said or did broke the impasse blocking their participation.” The men said women already had participation—because singers Marian Anderson and Mahalia Jackson were going to perform.

None of the women made their protests public at the time, in solidarity and for fear their criticism might be taken as ”emasculating” all black men, many of whom historically had suffered literal castration by white racists who were other men.

Yet King’s first success had been as the public face of Montgomery, Alabama’s bus boycott, made possible because a college teacher, Joanne Robinson, and a group of other middle-class black women, organized it.

Rosa Parks herself, a long-time activist, was represented by movement spokesmen as a seamstress too weary to give up her seat on the bus, because the men thought that was more passive-sounding and pitiable than acknowledging her years of activism. 

Gloria Richardson, who famously waved away the bayonet of a National Guardsman during a Cambridge protest in 1963, and Dorothy Cotton, who taught students how to protest peacefully even as people taunted, beat, and kicked them—no speaking at Dr. King’s March for them, either.  

Nor for Ella Baker, possibly the greatest organizer the Civil Rights Movement ever had. She also was rejected for the directorship of King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which she helped found and which she ran as “acting” director—a rejection, she noted, because “I was female. I was old. I didn’t have a PhD.” So she organized college students, forming the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), instead.

Surely, these women had earned the entitlement to walk side-by-side with the male leaders, and to speak at King’s March on Washington. Surely it was their due, their right, their prerogative.

Why doesn’t this country have a Baker Day, a Parks Day, a Bates Day? Why don’t we have days, streets, statues, and schools honoring Height and Nash and Murray and Robinson and so, so many others?

And will a future statue stand in the halls of the U.S. House of Representatives celebrating Nancy Patricia D’Alesandro Pelosi, the way the House honors a select few of the greatest Speakers in the history of our Republic?

Just asking.

"Some people are saying that we should ""work together"" with Trump because he won the election and he is ""everyone's president."" I say NO:

• I will not ""work together"" to privatize Medicare, cut Social Security and Medicaid. EVER!!! We have paid every single dime into Social Security. It is OURS, not Congress's to spend to court rich donors from Wall Street.
• I will not ""work together"" to remove civil rights from ANYONE--like the evisceration of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 OR the continued partisan gerrymandering by the GOP.
• I will not ""work together"" to destroy marriage equality and make it a states right to deny love between two people. Your ""religious liberty"" does not give you some right to take away my rights. Your faith, no matter how deeply felt, doesn't make our civil laws.
• I will not ""work together"" to deny health care to people who need it.
• I will not ""work together"" to increase the profits of the insurance companies. (Notice they rarely, if ever, go bankrupt).
• I will not ""work together"" to erase or redefine my trans brothers and sisters. I will not subject them to embarrassment in bathrooms.
• I will not ""work together"" to deny medical coverage to people on the basis of an alleged or actual ""pre-existing condition."" (At some point, we will ALL have a pre-existing condition if we live long enough).
• I will not ""work together"" to build a wall. (Walls have never worked, and eventually they all fall.)
• I will not ""work together"" to persecute Muslims.
• I will not ""work together"" to shut out refugees from countries where we destabilized their governments, so that we could have something more agreeable to our oligarchy.
• I will not ""work together"" to lower taxes on the 1%.
• I will not ""work together"" to increase taxes on the middle class and poor.
• I will not ""work together"" to help the president to line his pockets and those of his cronies.
• I will not ""work together"" to weaken and demolish environmental protections.
.
• I will not ""work together"" to sell American lands, especially National Parks, to companies which then despoil those lands.
• I will not ""work together"" to enable the killing in any way of whole species of animals just because they are predators, or inconvenient for a few, or because some people want to get their thrills killing them.
• I will not ""work together"" to waste trillions more on our military when we already have the strongest in the world.
• I will not ""work together"" to alienate countries that have been our allies for as long as I have been alive, and longer.
• I will not ""work together"" to slash education funding.
• I will not ""work together"" to take basic assistance from people who are at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.
• I will not ""work together"" to allow torture and ""black op"" prison sites.
• I will not ""work together"" and deny that there is a color imbalance in our criminal justice system. We need to address it.
• I will not ""work together"" with a mentality that twists peaceful protests into a lack of patriotism. Kneeling is NOT disrespectful to the flag.
• I will not ""work together"" with a leader who bullies others.
• I will not ""work together"" to ""take their oil.""
• I will not ""work together"" to get rid of common sense regulations on guns.
• I will not ""work together"" to eliminate the minimum wage.
• I will not ""work together"" to support so-called ""Right To Work"" laws, or undermine, weaken or destroy unions in any way.
• I will not ""work together"" to suppress scientific research, be it on climate change, fracking, or any other issue where a majority of scientists agree that #45 and his supporters are wrong on the facts.
• I will not ""work together"" to increase the number of nations that have nuclear weapons.
• I will not ""work together"" to put even more ""big money"" into politics.
• I will not ""work together"" to violate the Geneva Convention.
• I will not ""work together"" to give the Ku Klux Klan, the Nazi Party and white supremacists a seat at the table, or to normalize their hatred.
• I will not ""work together"" if it means ignoring the fact that a foreign country interfered with our elections while this administration has done nothing about it.
• I will not ""work together"" or honor a man who is a sexual predator.
• I will not ""work together"" with politicians who want to criminalize abortion... or regulate it out of existence.
• I will not ""work together"" to engage in voter suppression.
• I will not ""work together"" to normalize tyranny.
• I will not “work together” to eliminate or reduce ethical oversite at any level of government.
• I will not ""work together"" with anyone who is, or admires, tyrants and dictators who murder their opposition.
• I will not ""work together"" with #45 because I will not allow one man to feed upon the fears of the populace, blaming minorities for their condition or their inability to thrive.
• I will not ""work together"" to put children in cages.
• I will not ""work together"" to invite or condone violence against journalists. Or ignore the murder of one!!!
• I will not ""work together"" to dismiss and demoralize the intelligence community upon whom our national security relies.
This is the line, and I am drawing it. I will stand for honesty, love, respect for all living beings, and for the compassion and humanity that is the center of Life itself.
• I will use my voice and my hands, to reach out to the uninformed, and to anyone who will LISTEN for what's really so dangerous about #45, his friends and the Big Lie they spin to the world: to wit, that ""winning,""""being great again,""""rich,""""beautiful,"" or even ""white"" is anything more than nothing when others are sacrificed to glorify its existence.

"Civil Rights in Durham

Yesterday, I had the pleasure of being interviewed by WTVD News Anchor Tisha Powell in connection with a story she is working on relating to the release of an upcoming movie known as The Best of Enemies. The film is based on the unique friendship which developed between Ann Atwater, a Black community activist, and C.P. Ellis who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan when they met to work on a project known as Save Our Schools back in 1972. I shared with Tisha some of my recollections relating to the Civil Rights Movement in Durham and the desegregation of the Durham City School System.

"Civil Rights in Durham

Yesterday, I had the pleasure of being interviewed by WTVD News Anchor Tisha Powell in connection with a story she is working on relating to the release of an upcoming movie known as The Best of Enemies. The film is based on the unique friendship which developed between Ann Atwater, a Black community activist, and C.P. Ellis who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan when they met to work on a project known as Save Our Schools back in 1972. I shared with Tisha some of my recollections relating to the Civil Rights Movement in Durham and the desegregation of the Durham City School System.

"SONG OF THE DAY – January 5
PETE SEEGER – ""VIVA LA QUINCE BRIGADA""

The Abraham Lincoln Brigade, made up of Americans who volunteered to fight against Franco and his fascism in the Spanish Civil War, was formed on this day in 1937. 

The Spanish Civil War was fought from 1936 to 1939 between a democratically elected government and a revolt by far-right wing Spanish military officers, led by General Francisco Franco, who were supported by the fascist governments of Italy and Nazi Germany. 

Anti-fascists from all over the world answered the call to go to Spain to help them defeat the armed rebellion. This included over 3,000 American volunteers, most of whome were active communists, who made up the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (also known as the 15th Brigade). The Brigade suffered heavy losses, almost 700 of the volunteers died in the war. 

The Abraham Lincoln Brigade was the first American military unit to include Blacks and whites integrated on an equal basis.  Langston Hughes wrote, “Give Franco a hood and he would be a member of the Ku Klux Klan.”

“Viva La Quince Brigada” was one of a number of songs written in the 30s and 40s supporting the anti-fascist side in the war. Here, Pete Singer sings with his grandson Tao Rodriguez-Seeger in Barcelona in 1993. 

Long live the Fifteenth Brigade,

"Some people are saying that we should ""work together"" with Trump because he won the election and he is ""everyone's president."" I say NO:

• I will not ""work together"" to privatize Medicare, cut Social Security and Medicaid. EVER!!! We have paid every single dime into Social Security. It is OURS, not Congress's to spend to court rich donors from Wall Street.
• I will not ""work together"" to remove civil rights from ANYONE--like the evisceration of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 OR the continued partisan gerrymandering by the GOP.
• I will not ""work together"" to destroy marriage equality and make it a states right to deny love between two people. Your ""religious liberty"" does not give you some right to take away my rights. Your faith, no matter how deeply felt, doesn't make our civil laws.
• I will not ""work together"" to deny health care to people who need it.
• I will not ""work together"" to increase the profits of the insurance companies. (Notice they rarely, if ever, go bankrupt).
• I will not ""work together"" to erase or redefine my trans brothers and sisters. I will not subject them to embarrassment in bathrooms.
• I will not ""work together"" to deny medical coverage to people on the basis of an alleged or actual ""pre-existing condition."" (At some point, we will ALL have a pre-existing condition if we live long enough).
• I will not ""work together"" to build a wall. (Walls have never worked, and eventually they all fall.)
• I will not ""work together"" to persecute Muslims.
• I will not ""work together"" to shut out refugees from countries where we destabilized their governments, so that we could have something more agreeable to our oligarchy.
• I will not ""work together"" to lower taxes on the 1%.
• I will not ""work together"" to increase taxes on the middle class and poor.
• I will not ""work together"" to help the president to line his pockets and those of his cronies.
• I will not ""work together"" to weaken and demolish environmental protections.
.
• I will not ""work together"" to sell American lands, especially National Parks, to companies which then despoil those lands.
• I will not ""work together"" to enable the killing in any way of whole species of animals just because they are predators, or inconvenient for a few, or because some people want to get their thrills killing them.
• I will not ""work together"" to waste trillions more on our military when we already have the strongest in the world.
• I will not ""work together"" to alienate countries that have been our allies for as long as I have been alive, and longer.
• I will not ""work together"" to slash education funding.
• I will not ""work together"" to take basic assistance from people who are at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.
• I will not ""work together"" to allow torture and ""black op"" prison sites.
• I will not ""work together"" and deny that there is a color imbalance in our criminal justice system. We need to address it.
• I will not ""work together"" with a mentality that twists peaceful protests into a lack of patriotism. Kneeling is NOT disrespectful to the flag.
• I will not ""work together"" with a leader who bullies others.
• I will not ""work together"" to ""take their oil.""
• I will not ""work together"" to get rid of common sense regulations on guns.
• I will not ""work together"" to eliminate the minimum wage.
• I will not ""work together"" to support so-called ""Right To Work"" laws, or undermine, weaken or destroy unions in any way.
• I will not ""work together"" to suppress scientific research, be it on climate change, fracking, or any other issue where a majority of scientists agree that #45 and his supporters are wrong on the facts.
• I will not ""work together"" to increase the number of nations that have nuclear weapons.
• I will not ""work together"" to put even more ""big money"" into politics.
• I will not ""work together"" to violate the Geneva Convention.
• I will not ""work together"" to give the Ku Klux Klan, the Nazi Party and white supremacists a seat at the table, or to normalize their hatred.
• I will not ""work together"" if it means ignoring the fact that a foreign country interfered with our elections while this administration has done nothing about it.
• I will not ""work together"" or honor a man who is a sexual predator.
• I will not ""work together"" with politicians who want to criminalize abortion... or regulate it out of existence.
• I will not ""work together"" to engage in voter suppression.
• I will not ""work together"" to normalize tyranny.
• I will not “work together” to eliminate or reduce ethical oversite at any level of government.
• I will not ""work together"" with anyone who is, or admires, tyrants and dictators who murder their opposition.
• I will not ""work together"" with #45 because I will not allow one man to feed upon the fears of the populace, blaming minorities for their condition or their inability to thrive.
• I will not ""work together"" to put children in cages.
• I will not ""work together"" to invite or condone violence against journalists. Or ignore the murder of one!!!
• I will not ""work together"" to dismiss and demoralize the intelligence community upon whom our national security relies.
This is the line, and I am drawing it. I will stand for honesty, love, respect for all living beings, and for the compassion and humanity that is the center of Life itself.
• I will use my voice and my hands, to reach out to the uninformed, and to anyone who will LISTEN for what's really so dangerous about #45, his friends and the Big Lie they spin to the world: to wit, that ""winning,""""being great again,""""rich,""""beautiful,"" or even ""white"" is anything more than nothing when others are sacrificed to glorify its existence.

"Censored Version:

With a face like Mussolini, hands so teeny weenie,
     He's so proud, of his Emperor's New Clothes.
He's the Twitter In Chief, and the nation needs relief,
     From this con-man, and his Emperor's New Clothes.
          You can fool some of the people, some of the time,
     But who's gonna believe a man who never stops lyin',
The man, in the Emperor's New Clothes.

So in love with himself, he can't love no-one else,
      He's alone, in his Emperor's New Clothes.
Surrounded by sycophants, who shower him with compliments,
     This sad man, and his Emperor's New Clothes.
          He's an honorary member, of the Ku Klux Klan,
          An Army of Deplorables, and he's their biggest fan.
And they love him, and his Emperor's New Clothes.

     These clothes are so beautiful,
          The threads, are magical,
     So fine, they're invisible,
          Truly fantastical.
     Believe me, the world,
          Has never seen anything like it.
    Sensational, majestical,
          I am invincible!

Twiddle diddle dee, twiddle diddle dum, 
     I sit on the throne and twiddle my thumbs.
Twiddle diddle dee, twiddle diddle dum,
     I'll get them all with my two little thumbs!
     Rome burns, I twiddle my thumbs.
     Twiddle diddle diddle diddle, diddle diddle dum.

Guilty of collusion, livin' in delusion,
     He can't distinguish fact from fantasy.
Up against the FBI, he can run, but he can't hide,
     Justice, will get him, eventually.
He's standing' buck naked, HE's the one who's fakin', 
     But history's in the makin', 
          'Cause we're not gonna take it anymore.

"THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, THE MORE THEY REMAIN THE SAME...
Experiencing stagnation in Ferguson, ASI charged into St. Louis, Missouri. Surely they would underwrite the Renaissance Plain considering the millions of dollars they were spending trying to quell race riots erupting right down the street at the very moment. Realizing that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the main control center for the economic battlefield in America, we know the St. Louis Regional, Chamber would be an accessible introductory point to the war zone. Dr. Higginbothan was point person on this incursion expedition. Even though my effort to engage the economic battlefield had fizzed in Louisville, Kentucky, and several other cities, ASI, had high hopes as we made yet another charge onto the economic battlefield in St. Louis, Missouri.

 Unfortunately, Joe Reagan, the president of Louisville's Chamber of Commerce who vetoed the American Slaves Renaissance Plan in Louisville, Kentucky, by allowing his vice president, Carlos Phillips, to classify ASI in the same category as the Ku Klux Klan, was now President of the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce. The outcome was predictable. He wheeled out Austin Walker, the St. Louis Regional Chamber's almost black gatekeeper. He didn't classify ASI as the Klan, but, after giving ASI the runaround, Austin Walker clearly sabotaged ASI's mission. The President of ASI spent mounds of cash to sponsor a business breakfast at the St. Louis Regional Chamber in an effort to address St. Louis' business leaders, Austin Walker's job was to invite the St. Louis business community to the breakfast. Dr. Higginbotham would present an introductory PowerPoint, I would present the full Powerpoint and LTC TinaGay Riddle would make the sales pitch and ask the business community to fund The American Slaves, Inc. Renaissance Plan.

 At the last minute, we found that Austin Walker obviously didn't understand the plan, or either he was ordered not to support ASI's effort. He talked a good game, but on the day of the meeting, we found that he had made sure the business community wasn't invited to the meeting. His only explanation, which wasn't acceptable, was that the St. Louis Regional Chamber decided not to support ASI or the Renaissance Plan. He should have told us that before money was spent to host the affair. He would never tell us why the St. Louis Regional Chamber wouldn't consider ASI's effort, but we have a pretty good idea why not. His boss, Joe Reagan or whoever Joe takes his orders from didn't support rectifying the negative aftereffects of slavery. But all was not lost. A leading citizen in Sikeston, Missouri, right down the road from St. Louis and Ferguson, was at the business breakfast. He summoned ASI to his hometown, explaining that Sikeston needed help with its racial dilemma.

"My followers of sorts frequently reminded that slavery and racism are history when I write about it on this blog.  They have said that we can’t fix history and we need to write about things that are more current and to not keep dredging up something that happens a couple centuries ago.  So, with the help of the Equal Justice Initiative, here are some current events that have an Anniversary in November and December.  

November 2, 2004, Alabama voters reject a constitutional amendment that would have officially desegregated Alabama schools.  Law makers said that they like to keep the segregated schools for “white and colored children” laws on the books just in case. 

November 3, 2000, Alabama finally repeals the 1901 state constitutional ban on interracial marriages.  However, the majority of white voters were against the repeal. 

November 15, 2010, former police officer James Bonnard Fowler pleads guiltily to the 1965 murder of civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson in Marion Alabama. He was given a six month sentence.  

November 16, 2015, Texas history textbooks depicted enslaved people as “workers from Africa” rather than slaves. State law makers reject the call to change the textbooks and fact check the history recorded within.

November 18, 1983, James Cody is beaten, electrocuted, and threatened with castration by officers of the Chicago police department, that systematically tortured more than a hundred black men over thirty years. 

November 19, 1988, Judge in Dallas Texas gives reduced sentence to white student for targeting and killing two gay men.  He likened them to prostitutes and refused to give someone a life sentence for killing a prostitute. 

November 23, 2014, Tamil Rice, a black 12 year old boy, dies after being shot by the police for playing with a toy gun in a park by his home in Cleveland OH.  

November 26, 2016, Southern Poverty Law Center reports 400 physical and verbal attacks and incidents of intimidation and harassment of women, Muslims, immigrants, and African Americans since Trumps election.  

November 27, 1995, Criminologists predict a black youth crime wave calling them “super-predators” leading to laws that expose thousands of black kids to adult prosecution. 

December 10, 2008, Police officers in Shenandoah, PA face federal charges for covering up murder of Mexican immigrant Luis Ramirez by white teens spewing racial slurs.  

December 22, 2013, Federal court in Alabama upholds a redistricting plan designed by Republicans that reduces black voting power.  

Ok, now for an older historic events that should be mentioned

November 22, 1865, (Thanksgiving Day in 2018) just a couple of weeks before the 13th amendment was ratified, Mississippi requires local sheriffs to round up black orphans and sell them to whites as laborers. 

December 24, 1865, Christmas Eve, a group of Confederate Army veterans establishes the Ku Klux Klan in Pulaski, Tennessee.   

Here is another interesting event that I found that had an anniversary in October.

October 24, 2012, U.S. Justice Department files civil rights lawsuit against Meridian Mississippi officials for incarcerating black and disable children for dress code violations and talking back to teachers.  

It doesn’t look to me like slavery and racist practices are a thing of long past history.  It is still right in front of us.  I am not using the race card but showing the entire deck is stacked.

"Wealth Chatter Blog:  Grant & Ward

I just finished the exceptional Ron Cherow tome, Grant.   I didn’t know much about Grant other than he was a no-nonsense military general who vanquished the Confederate Army in 1865.   I had also assumed that he was a lifelong drunk and an inept, corrupt president.

Now, I’d rank Grant as one of the greatest, most principled leaders in US history, an underrated president given short shrift by historians.
 
Distilling his accomplishments, Grant devised, led and executed the military strategy that preserved the Union.   After the war, Grant’s leadership helped bound the country together again. 
    
As president, he championed the fifteenth amendment establishing voting rights for African-Americans, won a war against the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction and deftly navigated the country through one of the worst economic depressions in history.  
 
After alcohol problems derailed his military career before the Civil War, Grant was disciplined enough to manage his alcoholism for the rest of his remarkable career and life.

While his presidency was indeed rife with corruption, Grant was guilty of having a really bad judge of character.   Eventually, Grant’s naivety and judgment led to one of the most infamous investment fraud events in history.

The Grant & Ward fraud debacle was the foremost financial scandal of the nineteenth century.  After Grant unsuccessfully ran for a third presidential term in 1880, he embarked on a two-year world tour.  Running low of money, he returned to the US and joined his son Buck’s new Wall Street brokerage business, who had partnered with a swindler named Ferdinand Ward to form Grant & Ward.  
 
Grant personally invested $100,000 with Ward, who was by then running a classic Ponzi scheme, fraudulently paying outsized cash distributions to existing investors using new client’s investment capital.  Ward traded on Grant’s good name and the buzz from early investors led to a rush of new investment business.   As the scheme ballooned, Ward was forced to borrow large sums from banks to fund investor pay-outs, pledging the same investment securities multiple times.
 
When the scheme first showed signs of stress, Ward convinced Grant to borrow $150,000 from railroad baron Cornelius Vanderbilt to keep the firm afloat.   It was for naught as the scheme and the firm went down in flames in 1884, destroying all client’s investment accounts and leaving Grant financially destitute. 
 
Historians believe Grant was duped by Ward about the scheme, the verdict is uncertain about his son’s involvement.

Only Grant’s highly successful memoir, published by Mark Twain, repaid his debts and provided for his wife after his premature death from throat cancer in 1885. 
  
The most spectacular form of investment fraud is the Ponzi scheme, named after the swindler Charles Ponzi.  He was an Italian immigrant who swindled investors out of $20 million in the 1920s - that’s real money today.   But the Ponzi scheme of all schemes was pulled off by Bernie Madoff, who swindled $65 billion of investor capital before crashing in December, 2008.

What was noteworthy about Madoff was not only the magnitude of his scheme, but his ability to dupe clients for so many years via the sustained flow of new client money.
 
By the end, it was considered fashionable among the upper crust to have investments managed by Madoff.   Unfortunately, these naïve dolts convinced scores of charities to invest their endowment capital with Madoff and it ended tragically for many of them. 
 
What is so sad were the obvious signs that something was amiss with Madoff’s investment program.   First and foremost, Madoff promised his clients a 1% monthly return on their invested capital due to his “proprietary” investment process.  Talk about a suspension of disbelief!

I actually saw a copy of a sample Madoff client investment account statement after the crash.  The statement was so un-professional looking it almost appeared hand-typed.

The point is that although the main reason Madoff’s Ponzi scheme sustained itself for so long was social-psychological reasons, another key reason was that Madoff served as the custodian of the firm’s client investment accounts, which enabled him to concoct fake client account statements at will.
  
On a smaller scale, the investment advice profession gets tarnished every time you read about another financial advisor busted for a fraudulent investment scheme improperly using client investments.  It happens too often.

However, the reality is that investors can greatly reduce their risk from bad advisor behavior by using good common sense and some best practices, which I have enumerated below:

• Never invest with a advisor solely because of their social circles or based on your brother-in-law’s endorsement.  Be objective and do your homework.

• Understand the advisor’s investment process and maintain a healthy skepticism about any promise or guarantee of future investment return.  Make the advisor explain how your money is being managed.

• Know the firm that is serving as custodian of your investment assets.  A third-party custodian that produces independent account statements provides confidence about the market value of your investment holdings and account activity.

• Don’t write checks payable to an advisor or their firm.   Investment checks should be payable to the third-party custodian.

• Occasionally check on your current advisor and research prospective ones.  If licensed, visit www.brokercheck.org and type in their name to see their profile, including past client complaints and / or regulatory actions, all of which is public record.

• If the advisor is with a registered investment advisory firm (“RIA”), they are regulated either by the state or the SEC.  Review the RIA’s Form ADV to learn about any past client complaints and /or regulatory sanctions, all of which is also public record.

• Review your account statements on occasion and look for unusual activity.
 
• Understand the advisor’s outside business activities, which is also public record.  Where is the advisor spending most of their time?

• Choose an advisor that holds him/her self out as a fiduciary.

Now, don’t tackle me at the door with accusations at our next investment review meeting, but do ask many questions and see if you like our answers.
 
Until next time, be well….Tim

"I am calling for the resignation of Milpitas City Councilmember Anthony Phan. He is responsible for the hate mailer associating me with with the Communist Vietnamese government. It’s just as extreme as if it were the Ku Klux Klan or the Nazi’s, in the Vietnamese American refugee community. 

My mother fled war torn Communist Vietnam and risked her life at sea on a rickety boat. Her sister passed away on the journey. My mother was fortunate to be rescued at sea and through the United Nations was able to safely arrive to the United States. This hate mail cannot be anymore painful for my family. 

What hurts even more, is that I’m actually a member of the United States Armed Forces, swearing my life away to protect and serve our country. Councilmember Anthony Phan has no regard or honor for others, all so he can forward his political agenda with my opponent Bob Nunez. 

My campaign manager will be contacting the City Clerk this week to investigate where the tens of thousands of dollars came from, that funded enough mail to cover Milpitas. This special interest is not registered on the city website and there is no documentation to be found. That would be illegal. 

I’m calling for Councilmember Anthony Phan to put in his resignation. I’m calling for leaders across Milpitas to condemn Councilmember Anthony Phan’s hateful actions. If there is no resignation, there will be a recall.

"A reminder about what was flying over Senator Wesley Meredith’s home not so long ago:

Thu Apr 07, 2011
Pitts: Sure, you can fly Confederate flag, but why?

Myron B. Pitts

Sometimes, you have to see to believe.

On Monday, I drove by state Sen. Wesley Meredith’s house off Morganton Road on a tip he was flying the Confederate flag.

Sure enough, a version of the battle flag attached to the side of his home blew in the wind. The flag combined the familiar X of the rebel battle banner with the blue ""N.C."" field from the state flag.

Now, a man can do what he wants with his own property, within the law. And I have heard every conceivable defense for flying the racially charged rebel flag, a few of them reasonable.

But a state senator should know better.

I talked with Meredith, who was at the General Assembly in Raleigh on Wednesday, around noon.

He said the flag – which still was flying at that hour – belonged to his 16-year-old son, who initially had it on his truck.

He added: ""The reason he took that flag off his truck, he was going to a funeral for one of his black friends.""

His son removed the flag out of respect, then hung it at the house, Meredith said.

Meredith complained about living in a fishbowl.

""It was a youngster who had a flag on his truck,"" he said.

I don’t want to drag his son into this because responsibility rests with Meredith, who is not only a senator and public figure but the homeowner.

I asked him if he thought the flag sent the wrong message. He did not answer directly but said: ""I never have believed in slavery. I don’t believe in slavery in any way, shape or form.""

Of course not. But his comment shows he knows how the flag is perceived by some and yet still chose to let it continue flying.

He knows many black Americans consider the flag as representing hate, not just heritage, despite what apologists for the Confederacy say. He also knows the city in which he lives is 43 percent black, and his senate district includes many blacks in Cumberland and Bladen counties.

Perception counts.

Some people, fairly or not, will take a fresh look at Meredith’s motives in sponsoring legislation such as the Voter ID bill, which critics have said would hurt minority voting.

And blacks are not the only ones who view the rebel flag skeptically.

Many transplants here from elsewhere are not fans, seeing the flag as backward and frankly wondering why folks would celebrate a military defeat.

I tell non-Southerners: It’s complicated.

"A reminder about what was flying over Senator Wesley Meredith’s home not so long ago:

Thu Apr 07, 2011
Pitts: Sure, you can fly Confederate flag, but why?

Myron B. Pitts

Sometimes, you have to see to believe.

On Monday, I drove by state Sen. Wesley Meredith’s house off Morganton Road on a tip he was flying the Confederate flag.

Sure enough, a version of the battle flag attached to the side of his home blew in the wind. The flag combined the familiar X of the rebel battle banner with the blue ""N.C."" field from the state flag.

Now, a man can do what he wants with his own property, within the law. And I have heard every conceivable defense for flying the racially charged rebel flag, a few of them reasonable.

But a state senator should know better.

I talked with Meredith, who was at the General Assembly in Raleigh on Wednesday, around noon.

He said the flag – which still was flying at that hour – belonged to his 16-year-old son, who initially had it on his truck.

He added: ""The reason he took that flag off his truck, he was going to a funeral for one of his black friends.""

His son removed the flag out of respect, then hung it at the house, Meredith said.

Meredith complained about living in a fishbowl.

""It was a youngster who had a flag on his truck,"" he said.

I don’t want to drag his son into this because responsibility rests with Meredith, who is not only a senator and public figure but the homeowner.

I asked him if he thought the flag sent the wrong message. He did not answer directly but said: ""I never have believed in slavery. I don’t believe in slavery in any way, shape or form.""

Of course not. But his comment shows he knows how the flag is perceived by some and yet still chose to let it continue flying.

He knows many black Americans consider the flag as representing hate, not just heritage, despite what apologists for the Confederacy say. He also knows the city in which he lives is 43 percent black, and his senate district includes many blacks in Cumberland and Bladen counties.

Perception counts.

Some people, fairly or not, will take a fresh look at Meredith’s motives in sponsoring legislation such as the Voter ID bill, which critics have said would hurt minority voting.

And blacks are not the only ones who view the rebel flag skeptically.

Many transplants here from elsewhere are not fans, seeing the flag as backward and frankly wondering why folks would celebrate a military defeat.

I tell non-Southerners: It’s complicated.

The Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers calls it the ""duality of the Southern thing"" – how the same fertile land can nurture civil rights champions such as Martin Luther King Jr. and inveterate racists such as Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, whose Ku Klux Klan chose the rebel battle flag as a symbol.

"September 30, 1962 in Peace & Justice history
Hundreds of Ku Klux Klan members, white students and others, tried to keep a black student, James Meredith, 29, from attending classes at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. They were supported by the governor, Ross Barnett, who had explicitly resisted the order of the Federal Circuit Court.
In spite of the efforts to block his court-ordered registration, a deal to allow Meredith to register had been made between U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Governor Barnett. 
Meredith was secretly escorted onto campus; deputy U.S. marshals, border patrolmen and federal prison guards were stationed on and around the campus to protect him. Those standing guard were assaulted throughout the night with guns,bricks, Molotov cocktails, and bottles. photo: James Meredith being escorted to his classes by U.S.marshals and the military.

"THIS LETTER TO THE WHITE HOUSE HAS POLITICAL CONTENT!

Dear Mr. Trump:

Your Supreme Court nominee allegedly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez while at Yale and pushed his penis in her face. This is in addition to attacking Christine Blaley Ford, trying to rip off her clothes, holding her down on a bed, covering her mouth with his hand. Here’s corroboration of the Yale incident from The New Yorker:

A classmate of Ramirez’s … said that another student told him about the incident either on the night of the party or in the next day or two. The classmate … is “one-hundred-per-cent sure” that he was told at the time that Kavanaugh was the student who exposed himself to Ramirez. He independently recalled many of the same details offered by Ramirez, including that a male student had encouraged Kavanaugh as he exposed himself. The classmate, like Ramirez, recalled that the party took place in a common room on the first floor in Entryway B of Lawrance Hall, during their freshman year. 

And yet, your White House minions call Kavanaugh a “good man.” I bet he’s a “good man” just like you’re a “good man,” Sir.

You’re a “good man” who grabbed about “grabbing p***y” and how you could get away with because you were “a star.”

You’re a “good man” who disparaged a Vietnam War hero, John McCain.

You’re a “good man” who praised the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazis in Charlottesville as “some very fine people.”

You’re a “good man” – kidnapper would be the legal definition – who tore crying children from their parents, hundreds of them never to be reunited.

Please spare us the “good man” rhetoric. 

Very truly yours,

"We are better than this, or are we?

Last night while watching the news one story caught my attention. One of the incumbent Sonoma City Council members, Rachel Hundley, is running for reelection to the Sonoma City Council. According to the news reports and a quick Google search, Ms. Hundley has been the victim of an anonymous website using old pictures of her in attempt to shame her into not continuing her run for political office. Fortunately, Ms. Hundley is a strong independent woman and is not backing down from the vicious anonymous attack personal attacks. 

Recently during the Marin County Supervisors race, a similar Facebook Page was created specifically to discredit a Judy Arnold who was running for County Supervisor. After seeing the story last evening on the news, I did a Google search looking for information on anonymous political attacks using social media and internet websites. Surprisingly, this practice of creating anonymous fake news has become a political tactic now used even in local elections. 

Another recent example was an anonymous website attack on candidate Josh Butner, a retired Navy SEAL, during his bid for  Representative of the  California 50th District. An opponent or minion of the opponent created a website tying Mr. Butner to Duncan Hunter a Republican under current Federal investigation. The site also claims that Butner’s father, a retired Arizona judge, was linked to the Ku Klux Klan. 

Fortunately,  Mr. Butner stood up for himself and was not intimidated by the website stating, “I have spent my entire life defending our nation from enemies foreign and domestic, it is disgusting to see that a political candidate would hide behind an anonymous website to smear and denigrate another candidate with deliberate falsehoods.”

I like to believe that the Citizens of Marin County and the City of Novato are above such dishonest tactics such as fake news and anonymous websites aimed at smearing and degrading local candidates. My fourteen-year experience living in Novato has illustrated the neighbor goodness of the majority of folks in this great City. Time and time again people rally around each other when help is needed. Individuals reaching out a helping hand is a common occurrence in our Medium sized City of fifty-five thousand people. 

While the City of Novato is a great place to live, we do have our minority who feel dirty tricks and political fake news is a useful tool to be used in local elections. I believe in Novato residents and know we are better than this. 

As I mentioned, during the failed Toni Shroyer for County Supervisor race, a Facebook page was created to denigrate Mrs. Shroyer’s opponent Judy Arnold. The page not only spread lies but used Mrs. Arnold’s picture as the icon of the person posting the fake news. Not only did the Facebook page remain active after the election but, the page is being updated and continues to be used to promote a political agenda. 

Mrs. Shroyer’s husband is now running for a spot on the Novato Unified School District Board. Will we see Facebook pages aimed at his opponents? I truly hope not as I do believe the residents of Novato are above fake news and smear tactics.

Might be time to ask Toni Shroyer, to take down the fake news Facebook page Judy Arnold Disclosed.

"Today's letter to the White House ... Lost in Space ...

Dear Mr. Trump:

You chose well in picking Rudy as your personal counsel. He is undoubtedly as unbalanced as you are, so you’re a good fit. Now he's told us that “truth isn’t truth.” I translate that to mean that you won’t talk to Mr. Mueller because everything you say will be a lie. 

We can imagine your criminal trial defense under such a harebrained advocate as Rudy: (1) the documentary evidence pointing to your campaign’s collusion with Russia was planted by Mark Fuhrmann, who is part of the deep state; (2) it was Hillary – not you -- who complimented the Russians on hacking into her own emails; (3) Mr. Mueller is a closet Democrat because he was saddened by the assassination of JFK; and (4) so what if you colluded? Your base loves you, as do the “very fine people” you praised in the Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi Party. 

But I see from your comments to Reuters that you have an even better defense up your sleeve. You claim the power to undertake the Special Counsel’s investigation yourself! This is clear proof of your insanity. The only person who can judge you is you, because you’re the only one who counts in your delusional world.

Imagine! Hitler rises from the grave to investigate and prosecute Nazis at the Nuremberg trials! Imagine! O.J. Simpson takes over his prosecution for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend! Imagine! James Wilkes Booth rises from the grave to take over his prosecution for the assassination of President Lincoln. 

Why didn’t you think of this earlier? Only one reason: you didn’t have Rudy as your closest advisor and defender. 

Here’s a way of thinking of your presidency, your mental state, and that of your personal counsel: Lost in Space.

"White Nationalists Will Be Marching at Our Nation’s Capital on the Anniversary of the Death of a Peaceful Protester 

This coming Sunday, August 12th, will be the anniversary of the tragic death of Heather Heyer, who was killed when a White Nationalist ran his vehicle into her while she and others were peacefully engaged in a protest against a White Nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia last year. Unfortunately, a White Nationalist group has chosen to use this anniversary to conduct a rally in our nation’s capital, across the street from the White House, where they hope to bring together hundreds of people in support of their separatist, divisive views. 

The rally will be known as “Unite the Right.” From what I’ve read, among the featured guest speakers will be none other than David Duke, who at one point was one of America’s greatest known leaders in the Ku Klux Klan who openly endorsed and supported President Donald Trump’s candidacy in the Republican Primaries and in the General Election. All of this is occurring while at the same time we have mainstream news anchors such as Lauren Ingraham of Fox News speaking out in favor of things that White Nationalists have embraced for years about the changing demographics in America which is feeding divisiveness and cultural elitism. 

We should all be deeply concerned about the direction our country is moving at this time. Having grown up in the 1960’s, and personally observed how far our country has come in opening up doors of opportunity and facing racism and bigotry, I am saddened by this turn of events, however, I am relentlessly committed to standing up, speaking out, and confronting those who would divide us, our country, and our community.",2018-08-11T12:07:29+0000,McKissick for NC Senate,0,99,5000,9999,0.978918,North Carolina,0.01436,South Carolina,0.004888,Tennessee,0.001833,Virginia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Read this powerful essay from David Goodman, the brother of slain civil rights activist Andrew Goodman, and the president of The Andrew Goodman Foundation:

""When my brother, Andrew Goodman, was 20 years old, he traveled to Mississippi with 1,000 other student volunteers to participate in Freedom Summer of 1964. He joined as an ally with African-Americans who were struggling to overcome discrimination and intimidation to gain access to the ballot box. 

""On his first day in Mississippi, he and two other civil rights workers were murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan for their work to uphold the values of our democracy.""

""Today, threats to voting rights continue. The student leaders in The Andrew Goodman Foundation’s Vote Everywhere program on 56 campuses across the country carry on my brother’s legacy by protecting voting rights for young people and others who face electoral discrimination.""

""As we commemorate the 54th anniversary of my brother’s disappearance and murder, The Andrew Goodman Foundation is taking action to end student voter suppression in Florida.""

""Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner has created an impediment to student voting through his unconstitutional interpretation of the state’s early voting law.

"We all know that Russia interfered in our elections. They used a multi pronged attack employing several methods that combined made a very effective campaign to sway the 2016 election in trump’s favor. 

1,  Essentially spreading rumors that consisted of partially factual information that by itself would be innocuous, but the information was altered just enough to fan the flames of speculation and chaos. Essentially weaponizing that information to sow doubt and confusion about Secretary Clinton to either discredit her potential presidency or diminish her chances of winning. A very effective tool called Information Warfare.  

2, Disseminating said disinformation in paid advertisements on the extremely low cost platforms of social media, targeting the already extremely conservative right wing that has been increasingly populated by Racists, Neo Nazi’s,  and Members of the Ku Klux Klan. 

3, Exploiting the already reactionary positions of the 30 year long campaign of the right wing media in talk radio and Fox news by providing that “dirt” on Secretary Clinton. Especially talk radio host such as like Breitbart and Rush Limbaugh. 

4, Hacking the DNC server to find the “Fence Sitters” to identify states that could be swung to the right but are largely ignored since they are usually liberally inclined. Then sending the mentioned disinformation to those states in the form of constant bombardment of advertising through social media, television, radio and US Mail. This has been attempted in the 1970’s by the Republican Party resulting in the Watergate Scandal that resulted in the resignation of then President Nixon. 

This is from information that is available in public record in the form of Indictments against 25 Russians. The indictments are detailed accounts that though Russians are never going to see the inside of a courtroom, they shed an extremely bright light into what happened during the 2016 election.  

Trump’s campaign timing was eerily coordinated with Russia’s Campaign, and the fact that he has an actual history with Russia in the form of real estate dealings plus reported contacts with Russian spies and members of the Trump Campaign warrant an investigation, just like what is being undertaken by Special Counsel Mueller. 

Whether or not Trump actually was in cahoots with the Russian’s effort to sway our elections toward him, he is the beneficiary of that endeavor. Placing his entire presidency’s legitimacy in doubt. Trump can’t admit that there was election interference without damaging his already fragile credibility.

This information needs to be sent out to every single “On the Fence” voter in advance of the Midterm Elections. They need to be encouraged to vote blue to defang the Trump Administration’s disastrous administration, and to not fall for the Russian effort to dismantle our Representative Democracy.

Vladimir Putin, war criminal

The Russian leader has a long record of inhumanity.

By ALEXANDER J. MOTYL 
1/7/17, 5:23 AM CET

""The record speaks for itself: Putin is a killer and war criminal no different in the breadth and depth of his criminality than the Serbian war criminal, Slobodan Milošević. He must be treated as such by world leaders with even a minimal commitment to human rights and basic decency.

What should world leaders do?

First, they should openly condemn Putin’s behavior. Silence implies endorsement, and policymakers must understand their moral standing, and that of their countries, is on the line if they refuse to take a public stand.

One day, Putin will be gone, and Russia’s democratic opposition will be able to make their country a decent, law-abiding state.

Second, they should refuse to shake his hand, attend photo ops with him and create the impression that they accept his behavior. Unless Trump is willing to embrace former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in public, he should refrain from doing the same with Russia’s criminal leader.""

"Immigration to Assimilation

From its beginnings, the United States has been shaped by people from many nations. Some of the men considered today to have been the founders of the United States were born far from the thirteen original colonies. Alexander Hamilton, for example, was born on the island of St. Kitts in the British West Indies. Nonetheless, issues surrounding immigration and citizenship have caused debate—and controversy- -since the 1790s. Historical Background With each new wave of immigration, Americans responded with a spectrum of attitudes ranging from not so happy to the outright hostile. As we review the topic of immigration from the early nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century we must look at the cultural context of the US which supported the concept of fear of the “Other”, to justify genocide and stealing of the land of the Native, stealing parts of Mexico and enslavement of the African. Ironically, the so-called founding founders and other foreigners alike, all came from somewhere else and comprised the United States. All Americans had contributed help and inspiration from people and ideas from various countries.
  Many U.S. citizens voiced suspicions of foreigners and immigrants at various times throughout its history. In 1798, a period of diplomatic tension with France culminated in the passage of a series of laws known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. Where immigration was concerned, the bill extended the period of residency required for Citizenship from five to fourteen years. It also allowed the president (John Adams at the time) to deport any “alien” considered to be “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.” By 1800, the sentiment behind the acts had diminished, but would revive decades later as German and Irish immigrants came to the United States in larger numbers. Challenges: The Know-Nothings versus Immigration during the Antebellum Period, where German and Irish immigrants left their homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from famine to political repression. However, due to the culture of fear of the “Other”, many native-born Americans (White Anglo-Saxon protestants) resented these new arrivals. In 1849, some organized into an anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant political group famously called the “Know-Nothings,” which derived its name from the secrecy of its members.
Know-Nothings believed that native-born Americans were superior to the newly arrived immigrant groups on the basis that Irish and German immigrants tended to be poorer and Catholic, which Know-Nothings took as traits of cultural and economic backwardness. The Irish became economic scapegoats during periods of economic uncertainty, a pattern that would repeat itself during subsequent waves of immigration. Resentment toward the Irish began to abate after the Civil War when Irish American communities became more established. Immigration in an Industrializing America During the industrial era, immigrants from various parts of Asia and Eastern and Southern Europe came looking for a better life. Tales of the gold rush in the American West drew thousands of Chinese immigrants into North America beginning in the 1850s, as Irish immigration peaked in the East. Like thousands of disappointed Americans, they found that their opportunities were not as bright as the gold they were seeking. These early Chinese immigrants became laborers in mines and railroads, helping to construct the Central Pacific Railroad. Others became agricultural laborers. A major downturn in the American economy during the 1870s caused a backlash against Chinese immigrants in the workforce. Coercion and violence were used to eliminate competition by Chinese laborers and businesses. The government changed the law and passed the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which excluded Chinese laborers from entering the country and Know Nothings barred all immigrants of Chinese descent from obtaining citizenship. It was the first legislation of its kind in American history. But it was the pro-immigrant voices of this era that would be most influential. The Republican platform stated, ""Foreign immigration which in the past has added so much to the wealth, resources, and increase of power to the nation…should be fostered and encouraged."" By the 1880's, steam power had shortened the journey to America dramatically. Immigrants poured in from around the world: from the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Southern and Eastern Europe, and down from Canada.  In the 1880s alone, 9% of the total population of Norway emigrated to America. After 1892, nearly all immigrants came in through the newly opened Ellis Island. 
 Between 1880 and 1920, an estimated 4 million Italian immigrants entered the United States. Many of them passed through the cramped processing center at Ellis Island just outside of New York City; Ellis Island would become a symbol of immigration during these decades. This generation of Italian immigrants hailed from rural and less developed areas and performed unskilled labor. Like other immigrant groups, Italians faced harsh conditions in these unskilled jobs. Italians who tried to fight these conditions by joining unions found that many established unions would not accept foreign born workers. Like the Irish before them, Italians became scapegoats for economic difficulties as jobs became fiercely contested. Pseudoscientific theories described them as inferior to Northern and Western Europeans because of their “Mediterranean” blood, and Nativist elements blamed them for everything from domestic radicalism to organized crime. Italians living and working in towns and cities across the United States were subject to physical attacks by anti-immigrant mobs or organized groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. The area now known as Poland was not an independent country during the nineteenth century. Divided between three Empires – Prussia, Austro-Hungary, and Russia – Poles confronted economic difficulties as well as political and religious repression. By 1910, an estimated 900,000 Polish immigrants had entered the United States from both the East and West coasts. Poles spread throughout many different regions and contributed the growth of Midwestern states such as Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Others remained in New England. Polish immigrants established themselves in heavy industries such as mining. They encountered the same workplace difficulties as other immigrants struggling with low wages and were subject to anti-immigrant prejudices. From Ellis Island to Main Street Anti-immigrant sentiment peaked again after the end of World War I. New immigration restrictions put into place by Congress established quotas limiting most immigration by groups outside of Western Europe
 For Mexicans victimized by the Revolution, Jewish Immigrants fleeing Nazi Persecution in Eastern Europe and Russia, and Armenians escaping the massacres in Turkey, America provided refuge. And for millions of immigrants, New York provided opportunity. In Lower New York, one could find the whole world in a single neighborhood. Between 1880 and 1930, over 27 million people entered the United States - about 12 million through Ellis Island. But after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, American attitudes toward immigration began to shift. Nationalism and suspicion of foreigners were on the rise, and immigrants' loyalties were often called into question. Through the early 1920s, a series of laws were passed to limit the flow of immigrants.
  The era of immigration ended for the time being. Even so, many who were already living in the United States built lasting communities and contributed to their new country. Many among the recently arrived groups made great strides in American society, but some found it more difficult. Chinese immigrants maintained strong support networks known as “Chinatowns”-Chinese American communities in major urban areas throughout the country. Nonetheless, Chinese immigrants would continue to struggle with negative stereotypes. Italian and Polish immigrants also maintained strong support networks, as their children adapted to the new environment. Irish Americans steadily made inroads into American life and even fielded presidential candidates! Several American soldiers who served during World War II were descended from recent immigrants, such as the nearly one million Italian Americans who served in the Armed Forces. In many ways, during the postwar era integration became the catchword for foreign-born Americans and their children. Despite recurring fears that immigration would stain the fabric of American society, these immigrant groups became uniquely American while also preserving their own traditions.  
  In this era, for the first time in US history, attitudes began to shift towards immigrants in this country. American Immigrants were instrumental in winning WWI and WWII, taking part in the post war economic boom.  Immigrants were instrumental in Unions and helped their fellow Americans achieve livable wages, better working conditions, Child Labor Laws and enriching American life. Jewish Americans along with other immigrants were staunch supporters of Civil Rights and freedom, equality and justice for all! By the early 1960s, calls for immigration reform were growing louder. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed the Hart-Cellar Act into law. Gone was the quota system favoring Western Europe, replaced by one offering hope to immigrants from all the continents! From all over the world immigrants arrived on our shores, strengthened our economy, bringing with them their own histories, traditions, and ideas, all of which broaden and enrich our sense of what it means to be an American.  As we overcome the fear of the “Other” we let go of the ignorant and insecure notion of someone is inferior or superior based on a perceived difference.  We learn to celebrate our differences while realizing E Pluris Unum!  God bless you, and God bless America!",2018-05-27T18:07:59+0000,,0,99,0,999,1,New Jersey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Rename St*pleton for All Responds: “A Definitive Majority Wants a Name Change. It’s Not Enough, But It’s Real Progress.”

The results are in: 261 (58%) Yes votes versus 189 (42%) No votes to remove “Stapleton” from the name of our neighborhood association, Stapleton United Neighbors (SUN). Although a definitive majority of voters support the name change, the Stapleton community has not met the 66% threshold required to amend SUN’s bylaws. This outcome is disappointing and goes against the rising tide: Other neighborhood organizations, such as The Stapleton Foundation (now The Foundation for Sustainable Urban Communities), the Stapleton Citizens Advisory Board (CAB), and the Stapleton Development Corporation (now SDC), have already discontinued honoring Mayor Benjamin F. Stapleton, due to his membership in and enabling of the Ku Klux Klan in Denver during the 1920s. A supermajority of 66% to change the name would have been another step in the right direction for our community.

This issue is not new. Objections to the use of the name Stapleton have been raised since the very beginning of the old airport’s redevelopment, when the SDC formed a committee that created a written policy restricting the developer to use of the name as a locater for marketing purposes only. Those concerns were minimized and dismissed by Forest City in favor of making the name “Stapleton” central to their branding and marketing campaigns. In 2015, Black Lives Matter 5280 revived this issue and took the initiative to push for the name change, and in 2017, Rename St*pleton for All picked up the torch and is carrying on this work.

We believe that the momentum of the people is in the direction of change. We live here. We are raising our families here. And we are not going away. As our late, beloved leader Dr. Gregory Diggs once said, “We will be back.” We will continue to educate the community through our cultural history program Denver Faces Our KKK History Together. We now are very confident that as more and more people learn this history, they will own it—in order to disown it.

We will continue to partner with those who share our desire to make our community one that is truly welcoming to all residents. In their statement releasing the vote results, SUN affirmed their commitment to working on inclusivity and equity, and we welcome the opportunity to collaborate.

We thank everyone who came out to vote on Tuesday, those still on the fence, and even those who voted no. To the growing community of people who are willing to work toward a more welcoming, equitable neighborhood, we have this message: Our work is not done. SUN’s name may not change yet, but we have proven we are a definitive majority and we are stronger for this vote. We invite you to join us in moving forward because we believe that we are better people than our history may suggest, and we will do the work to make this the community and world we want to live in. The name is only the beginning.",2018-05-19T17:36:50+0000,,0,99,0,999,1,Colorado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
