"This is UNDEMOCRATIC. The lack of international media coverage and the lack of social media coverage of atrocities occurring in Indonesian-occupied West Papua, is a direct result of the Indonesian government strategically preventing the world from viewing their disturbing operations on the ground. Over this past weekend, 43 students in a dormitory in Surabaya were arrested by Indonesian forces after allegations that they threw an Indonesian flag in a sewer. After their arrests, mobs of Indonesians began to form chanting racist slurs and threatening to kill Papuans. West Papuans do not find the Indonesian flag to be representative of them as a nation. West Papuans can face up to 15 years of imprisonment for raising their Morning Star Flag, which represents the nation and people of West Papua. They have long called for indpendence from Indonesia. Their lands have been subjected to mining by multinational corporations in collusion with the Indonesian government-without consultation. Over the past few decades it is estimated that over 500,000 indigenous West Papuans have been slain by the Indonesian government on their indigenous lands. #FreeWestPapua #PapuaExit #TurnitBackOn #WestPapua #Amazon #Genocide @papuaexit @freewestpapua.australia @freewestpapuacampaign @freewestpapua @shaunking",2019-08-22T21:57:06+0000,,0,99,10000,49999,5.4E-5,Christ Church,0.034989,Batna Province,0.039168,Blida Province,0.019343,Biskra Province,0.01945,Béjaïa Province,0.033917,Tlemcen Province,0.028881,Tizi Ouzou Province,0.011252,Tiaret Province,0.041901,Sétif Province,0.005412,Saïda Province,0.057761,Oran Province,0.014574,Mostaganem Province,0.012592,Médéa Province,0.051599,Constantine Province,0.225151,Algiers Province,0.012485,Djelfa Province,0.003215,El Taref Province,0.000857,Greater Accra Region,0.000107,Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur,0.000107,Westmoreland Parish,0.000482,Saint James Parish,5.4E-5,Saint Elizabeth Parish,0.000321,Saint Catherine Parish,0.00134,Saint Andrew Parish,5.4E-5,Portland Parish,5.4E-5,Manchester Parish,5.4E-5,Point Fortin,0.000536,Tunapuna-Piarco Regional Corporation,5.4E-5,Siparia Regional Corporation,0.014038,Bouïra Province,0.011413,Guelma Province,5.4E-5,San Juan-Laventille Regional Corporation,0.016342,Chlef Province,0.022719,Tipaza Province,0.004126,Tindouf Province,0.00284,Tamanrasset Province,0.007823,Souk Ahras Province,0.009752,Relizane Province,0.012967,Ouargla Province,0.002893,Naâma Province,0.016128,Mila Province,0.009055,Khenchela Province,0.000857,Illizi Province,0.005144,Ghardaïa Province,0.008466,El Oued Province,0.00209,El Bayadh Province,0.01511,Boumerdès Province,0.018271,Jijel Province,0.017307,Bordj Bou Arréridj Province,0.005197,Béchar Province,0.035203,Annaba Province,0.006858,Aïn Témouchent Province,0.011413,Aïn Defla Province,0.005305,Adrar Province,0.014146,Tébessa Province,0.024916,Skikda Province,0.014574,Sidi Bel Abbès Province,0.010556,Oum El Bouaghi Province,0.012967,M'Sila Province,0.009055,Mascara Province,0.009484,Laghouat Province,0.000375,Sangre Grande Regional Corporation,0.000107,Princes Town Regional Corporation,5.4E-5,Saint James,5.4E-5,Western Province ,5.4E-5,Tasmania,0.000107,Eastern Cape,5.4E-5,Texas,5.4E-5,Pennsylvania,5.4E-5,Nelson Province,5.4E-5,Auckland Region,0.003054,Port Moresby,5.4E-5,Sandaun Province,0.000161,Morobe Province,5.4E-5,Manus Province,5.4E-5,East Sepik Province,0.000107,East New Britain Province,5.4E-5,Eastern Highlands Province,0.000214,Toledo District,0.000482,Lagos State,0.000107,Stann Creek District,0.001607,Orange Walk District,0.000321,Corozal District,0.002518,Cayo District,0.003215,Belize District,0.000214,Vieux-Fort,5.4E-5,Laborie,0.000482,Gros-Islet,0.002358,Castries,0.000268,Martinique,5.4E-5,Saint Philip,5.4E-5,Saint Peter,0.002465,Saint Michael,5.4E-5,Western Australia,0.000214,Federal Capital Territory,0.000107,Penal-Debe Regional Corporation,0.000107,Ondo State,5.4E-5,Diego Martin Regional Corporation,0.000161,Chaguanas,0.000589,Couva-Tabaquite-Talparo Regional Corporation,5.4E-5,Tobago,0.000268,San Fernando,0.000697,Port of Spain,5.4E-5,Rio Claro-Mayaro Regional Corporation,0.000107,Arima,5.4E-5,Zamfara State,5.4E-5,Gombe State,0.000107,Ekiti State,0.000107,Sokoto State,5.4E-5,Rivers State,5.4E-5,Enugu State,0.000429,Ogun State,0.000107,Bauchi State,0.000214,Abia State,5.4E-5,Kebbi State,5.4E-5,Jigawa State,0.000107,Edo State,0.000161,Delta State,5.4E-5,Adamawa State,0.000268,Oyo State,5.4E-5,Niger State,0.000375,Kano State,5.4E-5,Katsina State,0.000214,Kaduna State,0.000107,Cross River State,0.003108,Tissemsilt Province

"Starting the night of August 22, one westbound lane on State Route 60 will be closed for six months in Riverside County’s Badlands area. 

To prepare for this lane closure, crews will conduct full closures of westbound Route 60 on two nights -- August 22 and August 23 from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.

The project is widening 4.5 miles of Route 60 to improve safety and traffic flow for commuters, trucks, and travelers to and from desert resorts.

"this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
—Abraham Lincoln
Both our Republican and Democrat party have lost sight . They don’t pass  Legislation for the people anymore it’s all about party politics. It’s time to stand up and say enough.first we have to elect someone that is for the people.  
150 years ago I would of considered myself a republican but in today’s culture I’m a independent. With conservative and liberal values.
We deserve better from our government and when they fail to represent the people it is our job to stand up and support someone that will.
