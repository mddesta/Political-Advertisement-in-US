"*** POLITICAL OPINION-EDITORIAL ***

""Cory Booker: Paying It Forward and Why I Fight""
by U.S. Senator Cory Booker

In 1936, my dad was born in a small, segregated town in the mountains of North Carolina. He was born to a single mom who had health problems and a family who could not care for him, so a local family took him in and raised him as their own. He had no source of financial support and no tradition of college in his family, so my dad never considered going to college.

Will you take the NoKXL Pledge? Bernie Sanders Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris Pete Buttigieg Cory Booker Amy Klobuchar Kirsten Gillibrand Julián Castro Beto O'Rourke Jay Inslee Andrew Yang for President 2020 Marianne Williamson Tom Steyer

+  If elected, I pledge to take executive action on Day One to stop any construction on the Keystone XL pipeline — no matter what — and revoke the existing presidential permits issued unilaterally by President Trump for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, sending both projects back to relevant federal agencies to undergo legitimate environmental review and Tribal consultations.

+  I pledge to direct all federal agencies (State Dept., FERC, Army Corps) to submit these two projects, as well as all new pipeline and energy infrastructure projects to a true climate test, and reject permits for any project that would exacerbate our climate crisis.

+  I pledge to protect the property rights of farmers and ranchers from eminent domain abuse, and to honor the treaties the U.S. Government has signed with sovereign Tribal Nations.
