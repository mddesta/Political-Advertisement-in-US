"Our politicians are worthless. 

Most news media is against us. 

While we, the Freedom Lovers of Tioga County PA, are in the majoriy, our local institutions are NOT protecting our liberty and many do not respect the Bill of Rights. The freedom takers have too much influence despite their small numbers!

Too many people in positions of authority and leadership would not, could not, take and keep a simple pledge to uphold the Bill of Rights!

Many major businesses and other entities dance to the tune of the freedom takers. They don't want to support us. They want us to patronize them and keep our traps shut.

In their arrogance, they assume their freedom-taking ideas are somehow beyond criticism and our long-held moral and other convictions are deplorable! We voted for a President who would clean out DC, but it our responsibility to clean out the mini-swamp of freedom takers within Tioga County!

The other side wants us silent and shamed, afraid to even wear a MAGA hat or proclaim our deeply held beliefs, for fear we will be blacklisted by people and institutions in this very county where over 2/3rd of us voted against the very agenda these people espouse freely and openly while they shun and shame us and call us names!

We are done with that. We are done listening and having one-sided ""discussions"" that question our very right to exist as a free and sovereign people!

Are you comfortable in every business in this county telling them your true beliefs? Are the leading instutions, like our County Government, willing to declare this a Freedon Sanctuary and are they willing to defy any Red Flag laws meant to deny us our most sacred rights? 

If this County and its institutions REFLECTED our SUPER MAJORITY CONSENSUS things would be MUCH BETTER! 

NO DOUBT we would have more freedom and less social problems and far more economic prosperity, which is held back ONLY by freedom takers and their love of regulations, rules, and taxes!

It falls on us to change things. We start with ourselves, we start with mutual support. And it grows from there.

We have to come out of the shadows. We cannot continue to act like cowards and just let a tiny majority run this county into the dirt with their anti-freedom agenda!

We have to stop letting the freedom takers tell us what we can and cannot say.

We have to take this county and every one of our boroughs, townships, and school districts as well as all of our local institutions BACK. 

This is our pledge:

""I (state your full name) do solemnly pledge before God to defend and uphold freedom for all Americans in Tioga County PA, according to the original spirit and intent of the US Bill of Rights, against all hazards, foreign or domestic, all legal and reasonable means, SO HELP ME GOD!""

If this is is your pledge, you are a Freedomist! 

Join us. 

We are going to work together to support one another and promote freedom until we transform Tioga County into a FREEDOM SANCTUARY where the Bill of Rights is respected, upheld, and defended by all local officials and everyone with a badge or who holds a public trust!

First we gather virtually, then in every township and borough, then we act unilaterally within our vast legal means, then we watch the dominoes fall one by one one until this County becomes a freedom sanctuary!

That's the vision. We have nothing to lose by trying and everything to gain. If we do nothing, we not only hazard our freedom but the freedom of future generations!",2019-08-21T14:48:48+0000,Tioga County PA Freedomist Club,0,99,0,999,0.317181,New York,0.682819,Pennsylvania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
