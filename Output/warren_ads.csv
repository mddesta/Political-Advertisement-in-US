"President Trump has weaponized deportation in ways that are costly, ineffective, and designed to maximize pain. It’s time to end this cruelty — and refocus on true threats to public safety and national security instead. As president, I will decriminalize migration and refocus enforcement on serious criminal activity.

Entering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist Senator, it’s also a criminal violation. Since the early 2000s, this additional criminal provision has been used to build and sustain a massive immigration detention complex. 

In 2016, over half of all federal criminal prosecutions were for immigration violations — more than prosecutions for terrorism, organized crime, hate crimes, or financial fraud. This obsessive focus ties up federal prosecutors and overwhelms federal courts. It’s costly and unnecessary. And under Trump, it has become increasingly abusive. 
As president, I will immediately issue guidance to end criminal prosecutions for simple administrative immigration violations.

"On a typical presidential campaign, the candidate spends a lot of time holding swanky fundraisers in big cities listening to the issues that matter most to the wealthiest donors. But our campaign is different. Elizabeth isn’t doing those kinds of big donor events, she won’t spend hours a day on the phone with them asking for big checks, and she won’t take a dime from corporations, PACs, or federal lobbyists. Instead, she’s spending her time meeting people where they are and talking with them about the issues that matter in their communities. Elizabeth is running the campaign she wants to run — because she knows that to make big, structural change, we’ve got to build a movement. That’s why she wants to hear from you. Fill out our 2-minute survey to tell Elizabeth what issues matter to you in South Carolina.

"DEMOCRATS’ ANNIHILATION of the ENGLISH LANGUAGE and STANDARD PROSE—as 
DEMOCRAT Elizabeth Warren ISSUES her 163rd PUBLIC ”APOLOGY” for “INDIAN” LIES

TODAY: At a Native American Presidential Forum in Iowa:

     “I know that I have made mistakes. I am 
    sorry for harm I have caused. I have listened 
    and I have learned. A lot. And I am grateful 
    for the many conversations that we have 
    had together. It is a great honor to partner 
    with Indian Country.”

ANALYSIS (for normal English speakers)

▪️”mistake”  [Used incorrectly here. A “mistake” would be to put a first name on an application where a last name is supposed to go, and vice versa. Or to put the state in the blank where the city should go. However, writing that you are an Indian when you are not and never have been is not a “mistake” any more than writing that your age is “37” when you are actually 54. But modern Democrats or Leftists—as Orwell forewarned—use language only as a means of political manipulation.]

▪️”sorry for harm I have caused”   [Yes, to my campaign. Otherwise the “apology” would be direct, like the “old-fashioned” apology: 
     “I am sorry for what I did and for the 
     misrepresentations that I made that 
     accrued to my advantage. I was wrong to 
     take those advantages—and steal from 
     those who actually are Indian.”]

▪️”...listened and...learned”  [Throwaway line. Standard political consultant speech-writing boilerplate.]

▪️”grateful for the many conversations we have had together...”   [About as empty and devoid of meaning as can be strung together. Filler. Attempting to imply it has something to do with owning up to wrongdoing, but without actually admitting anything—the “conversations” could have been about anything.]

▪️”partner with Indian Country.”  [She meant “pander” instead of “partner” — meaning “I’ll say or do anything if you give me a pass for lying about being Cherokee.”

WARREN’s POLLING: NOW 2nd PLACE

We realize that Warren has overtaken U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the polls and—as a wildly enthusiastic media now happily proclaim every few minutes—now trails only Biden.

However, we stand by our assertion, made ten months ago, that Elizabeth Warren will not only not be president, she will not get the nomination.

"FAKE INDIAN DEMOCRAT SOCIALIST ELIZABETH WARREN IS A DESPICABLE FRAUD -- SHE'S ONE OF THE 1% IN THE UNITED STATES WORTH $8.75 MILLION IN 2019!!!     WHAT????   IT'S TRUE. WARREN EARNED A GREAT DEAL OF WEALTH AS A LAW PROFESSOR AND AS A POLITICIAN. NOW SHE'S AIMING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BY PANDERING VOTES FROM THE POOREST U.S. CITIZENS AND MINORITIES?  WHAT???

Elizabeth Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, have amassed a formidable financial fortune, placing her well within the 1% of highest-earning Americans.

What Is Elizabeth Warren's Net Worth?

Elizabeth Warren's net worth amounts to a consensus $8.75 million in 2019, a figure that is based on various financial statements, most notably the release of her federal tax returns -- 10 years in total through 2018.

In 2017, for example, Sen. Warren listed an annual growth income of $913,000 (combined with her husband, who is a Harvard University professor). $174,000 of that figure came from her job as a U.S. senator, while $430,000 came from her work as a top-selling author.

In 2018, she listed total household income of $905,742, with $324,687 listed as business income -- again, mostly from her book-writing earnings. Sen. Warren also listed her $175,000 Congressional earnings, along with her husband's $400,000 salary from Harvard University.

Warren spent the early portion of her presidential run apologizing for her claim of Native American ancestry, spotlighted by a DNA test that showed a statistically low level of Native American bloodlines, which at first Warren vigorously defended.

Yet after numerous calls for an apology, one notably from the Cherokee Nation (who deemed the ancestry claim as ""inappropriate and wrong"") Warren apologized in early 2019, and was able to largely put the issue behind her. That said, critics will be sure to resurrect the claim if Warren scores the Democratic presidential nomination in the summer of 2020.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

    MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered https://t.co/gRJZqDmGZ0

    — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"The story of America’s mistreatment of Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples is a long and painful one, rooted in centuries of discrimination, neglect, greed, and violence. Native history is American history, and we must be honest about our government’s responsibility in perpetuating these injustices for centuries. 

As a nation, we are failing in our legal, political, and moral obligations toward tribal governments and indigenous peoples. Washington owes Native communities respect – and much more. Washington owes Native communities a fighting chance to build stronger communities and a brighter future.
To achieve this, we must end the corruption that empowers giant corporate interests to trample the interests of indigenous peoples. We must end the neglect that allows Congress to chip away at nutrition assistance, health care, education funding, and other programs. And we must go further. We must ensure that America’s sacred trust and treaty obligations are the law of the land — binding legal and moral principles that are not just slogans, but instead reinforce the solemn nation-to-nation relationships with Tribal Nations. 

It will not be easy, but our government must uphold its commitments and promises to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples. We must recommit to the principles of protecting Tribal sovereignty and advancing Tribal self-determination in all federal decisions that affect Native communities. I have fought for this brighter future during my time in the Senate. And I am committed to achieving it as President of the United States.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"Our society and our economy demand so much of women — but they place a particular burden on Black, Latina, Native American, and other women of color. In 2017, Black women were paid 61 cents for every dollar white men made. Native women made 58 cents to a white man’s dollar — and Latinas earned just 53 cents to a white man’s dollar. And in the workplace, Black and Brown women are disproportionately mistreated. In a recent survey, nearly two-thirds of Black and Latina women reported experiencing racial discrimination at work. Even though Black women and Latinas are often the leaders and decision-makers in their own homes and communities, they hold only one spot on the Fortune 500 CEO list and less than 5% of Fortune 500 Board positions.

As a nation, we are failing in our legal, political, and moral obligations toward tribal governments and indigenous peoples. Washington owes Native communities respect – and much more. Washington owes Native communities a fighting chance to build stronger communities and a brighter future.
To achieve this, we must end the corruption that empowers giant corporate interests to trample the interests of indigenous peoples. We must end the neglect that allows Congress to chip away at nutrition assistance, health care, education funding, and other programs. And we must go further.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

    — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"It is absolutely disgraceful that a crowd of Philadelphia neighborhood residents heckled and actually threw trash at Police Officers who were under life-threatening attack by a vicious gunman firing hundreds of bullets at them. 

Six cops were shot and two were trapped in the building where the gunman was firing his automatic weapon. The Philadelphia Police were putting their lives on the line in that neighborhood trying to arrest drug dealers preying on the community. Yet these anti-Police fanatics chose to attack the Police who were there to protect them.

By most accounts these abusive disrupters were a minority within the neighborhood. It is unfortunate though that prominent political leaders have been notably silent. Is it too much to expect, for instance, that Democratic Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris will stop spreading the slanderous lie that the Police In Ferguson, Missouri murdered Michael Brown when the indisputable evidence demonstrated that Brown was a street thug who had just robbed a convenience store and was attempting to seize the Police Officer's gun? Both the State of Missouri and the Obama Justice Department found that shooting Michael Brown was justified. 

Great and courageous work by the Philadelphia Police. Despicable, disgraceful behavior by elements of the Philadelphia community. And loud silence by too many leaders who turn their backs on the Men and Women in Blue.

• We will strengthen our unions and give our workers a voice in corporate boardrooms.
• We will pass a 2 cent wealth tax on people with fortunes over $50 million.

And with that money:
  
• We will provide universal child care and universal pre-K.
• We will make public college free and restore our historically black colleges and universities.
• We will cancel student debt for 95% of people who have it.
