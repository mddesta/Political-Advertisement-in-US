"You Are Here - A Come From Away Story is an intimate feature documentary that goes deep into the community of Gander, Newfoundland where 38 airliners carrying over 6,500 passengers were forced to land after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The film pulls back the emotional layers surrounding the five days during which the community housed, fed and cared for the dislocated passengers.

"I am the victim of a cover-up.

I was the only black partner at the Pierce Bainbridge law firm and I am a double Harvard graduate. My mom came from the hills of Jamaica with nothing, my dad grew up in a lower-middle class Jewish household in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, they put everything into making sure their children had opportunities to succeed. John Mark Pierce, my law school classmate, convinced me to leave my job and join his fledgling firm. Now both he, and his partners, have been trying to destroy my life since I blew the whistle on financial misconduct. With the help of the Putney Twombly and Littler Mendelson law firms, they have done unspeakable wrongs.
 
In an effort to muzzle me, Pierce Bainbridge enlisted an employee to fabricate ridiculous allegations of sexual misconduct.  Without any discussion, Pierce banned me by e-mail, locked me out of my accounts and banned the entire firm from communicating with me forever; Pierce relied on offensive racial stereotype to demonize me, less than one minute after I was locked out, he labeled me a “sexual assaulter” to all of my partners.  Pierce and General Counsel Carolynn K. Beck claimed the ban was due to the “nature of the allegations;” however, a white partner candidate labeled a “sexual harasser” by a female partner was interviewed by the firm shortly thereafter.  

Pierce Bainbridge hired Beck’s personal friend Michael D. Yim of the Putney Twombly firm to stage a “sham investigation”. Documents proving my innocence were buried, lies from the false accuser ignored, I was told no “due process” for me, extortionate threats of bogus arrest were made, a time of incident was provided, I was not in the vicinity, Yim then claimed he misspoke. Former NYPD detectives have said the “investigation” was a farce. 

Just like with any cover-up, things kept getting worse. 
 
John Mark Pierce then publicly branded me an “extortionist”, a “terrorist” and a “sexual predator"", defamatory lies which have spread nationwide. It was devastating to see my mom read an article with my picture next to a header stating: “sexual predator”. 

Pierce Bainbridge now publicly claims I was a “corrosive” bad hire, however, two weeks before I was banished, my fellow partners appointed me Co-Chair of Diversity and Inclusion, as well as Assigning Partner (in charge of case assignments for the entire firm). These same partners then chose personal greed over integrity and stabbed me in the back; betrayals I will never forget.  
 
These three law firms acting in concert have threatened, bullied, deceived and defamed. However, I refuse to cower, and I will not bend the knee. My mother came to this country alone, and despite much adversity, she worked hard to build a better life. My parents raised me to believe in the truth and to fight for what is right. I refuse to give up and House Lewis will stand strong. They have wounded me deeply with their lies, but I will continue to persevere and continue to expose facts; their day of reckoning will come.

Beck claimed the ban was due to the “nature of the allegations;” however, a white partner candidate labeled a “sexual harasser” by a female partner was interviewed by the firm shortly thereafter.  

Pierce Bainbridge hired Beck’s personal friend Michael D. Yim of the Putney Twombly firm to stage a “sham investigation”. Documents proving my innocence were buried, lies from the false accuser ignored, I was told no “due process” for me, extortionate threats of bogus arrest were made, a time of incident was provided, I was not in the vicinity, Yim then claimed he misspoke. Former NYPD detectives have said the “investigation” was a farce. 

Just like with any cover-up, things kept getting worse. 
 
John Mark Pierce then publicly branded me an “extortionist”, a “terrorist” and a “sexual predator"", defamatory lies which have spread nationwide. It was devastating to see my mom read an article with my picture next to a header stating: “sexual predator”. 

Pierce Bainbridge now publicly claims I was a “corrosive” bad hire, however, two weeks before I was banished, my fellow partners appointed me Co-Chair of Diversity and Inclusion, as well as Assigning Partner (in charge of case assignments for the entire firm). These same partners then chose personal greed over integrity and stabbed me in the back; betrayals I will never forget.  
 
These three law firms acting in concert have threatened, bullied, deceived and defamed. However, I refuse to cower, and I will not bend the knee. My mother came to this country alone, and despite much adversity, she worked hard to build a better life. My parents raised me to believe in the truth and to fight for what is right. I refuse to give up and House Lewis will stand strong. They have wounded me deeply with their lies, but I will continue to persevere and continue to expose facts; their day of reckoning will come.

"THEY’RE NOT CONSERVATIVE: Chauncey ""Greg"" Gregory is an elitist.

He's been in the Statehouse for decades.

He is a Republican In Name Only (RINO).

And given the chance, he will politicize terrorist attacks like the one in Dayton to take your guns.

He teams up with the most liberal Democrat in the state Senate to co-sponsor gun control bills every year - none of which would have saved any lives in El Paso or Dayton.

We have a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to protect ourselves. 

Our 2A right has been slowly eroded by politicians like Chauncey over the years.  And with the threat of “red flag” gun confiscation laws, they could be eroded even more.

We have to restore our rights here in South Carolina by forcing our legislators to pass H.3456 - a bill that would make CWP optional, legalize open carry and recognize CWP holders from every other state.

Text the word CARRY to the number 52886 on your cell phone. 

Demand your state politicians kill ALL gun control bills and pass H.3456 immediately to restore our rights.

CARRY to 52886.",2019-08-13T12:52:37+0000,Freedom Action Network of South Carolina,0,99,1000,4999,1,South Carolina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We’re All Enemies of the State: Draconian Laws, Precrime & the Surveillance State | By John W. Whitehead

If the government is consistent about any one thing, it is this: it has an unnerving tendency to exploit crises and use them as opportunities for power grabs under the guise of national security. 

Cue the Emergency State, the government’s Machiavellian version of crisis management that justifies all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security. Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, “unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters”: the government has been anticipating and preparing for such crises for years now. It’s all part of the grand plan for total control.

The government’s proposed response to the latest round of mass shootings—red flag gun laws, precrime surveillance, fusion centers, threat assessments, mental health assessments, involuntary confinement—is just more of the same. 

It’s a simple enough formula: first, you create fear, then you capitalize on it by seizing power. For instance, in his remarks on the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, President Trump promised to give the FBI “whatever they need” to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism. Let that sink in a moment. In a post-9/11 America, Trump’s promise bodes ill for whatever remnants of freedom we have left. With that promise, flippantly delivered without any apparent thought for the Constitution’s prohibitions on such overreach, the president has given the FBI the green light to violate Americans’ civil liberties in every which way. 

This is how the Emergency State works, after all.

"Hate crimes based on political ideology. 

The FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity or gender.”

A political ideology is a certain set of principles or doctrines in a social movement composed of a large group of people that explains how society should work, and offers a political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order.

The shootings in El Paso and Dayton have prompted discussions on mass killings, mass shootings, and hate crime. 

The FBI defines a mass killing as any instance in which four or more people are killed, not counting the suspected killer. So if you follow that definition, there have been about 30 shootings in 2019 that qualify as mass killings.

The Gun Violence Archive, an independent organization tracking gun violence, defines a mass shooting as a situation in which four or more people are shot. By this metric there have been about 250 mass shootings in 2019. 

We have looked at data over the last 10 years involving mass shootings and have found 18 instances that qualify as hate crimes based on political ideology. We included 2 standout incidents of hate crimes using weapons other than firearms. Below are these 20 incidents, with a brief summary to start. Please share any other incidents of hate crimes based on political ideology that we may have overlooked. The question is, should we as a society try to reduce hate crimes based on political ideology? And if so, how? Share your views at synthisophy.com!

"The Mass Shooting Domestic Terrorist Attacks in Texas and Ohio do require a response by our Government.  However, it does not require a response against the law abiding citizens of this nation. 

I will not allow a Terrorist to convince me to support infringing on your Constitutional Rights, including the 2nd Amendment and Due Process.  

Once you start giving your rights up to the government the only way to get them back is through rights you no longer have. 

So Instead of having a conversation on stripping the God Given Rights of the American People, lets have a conversation about going after Domestic Terrorists like White Nationalist, ANTIFA, and Criminal Street Gangs.

"Across the United States, students are returning to school amidst another nationwide tragedy. And once again, teachers are faced with the challenge of establishing a positive, safe and reflective classroom in the wake of horrific violence.

Our new teaching idea, “Teaching in the Wake of Violence”, can help you address the recent attacks in a manner that focuses on emotional processing (heart before head) while building community resilience.

"The Gun Control Fallacy

Gun control to put it simply, is impossible. It is impossible because it is not an attempt to control guns, but is an attempt to control human behavior. Would it be possible to implement car or knife control? Human behavior dictates whether or not there will be a school shooting, not laws. Laws can only provide for punish for the crime, not prevent it. Do speed limit signs prevent speeding.

The looney Left never miss an opportunity to take advantage of the deaths of selected individuals, school children in this case, to advance a political agenda while using their favorite tools which in this case happens to be school children. The tactic of using and indoctrinating children is a mainstay of Liberal political philosophy. Just as it is with communists, fascists, socialists, and nazis’. 

These cries from the Left and the ignorant children they have incorporated into their agenda are not about actually protecting the children. How do we know this? It’s simple. When it is proposed to protect children while at school with armed personnel in some fashion, Liberals are unalterably opposed to it. They make stupid emotional arguments such as that schools shouldn’t be like armed fortresses or some such, or that it will be emotionally traumatic to the children. These fallacious arguments are exhibit one that they couldn’t care less about protecting the children, but are more interested in restricting, then reducing, to be followed by eliminating gun ownership rights.

Don’t think for one moment that just because the Constitution protects gun ownership that it is a right that cannot be taken away by usurpation. The Federal government has no Constitutional authority to make us buy anything, but the Supreme Court said it does have the authority to make us buy health insurance. Obamacare is unconstitutional which means that this ruling by the Supreme Court was itself unconstitutional. The Constitution is merely a collection of words protected by the goodwill of men, and don’t count on that goodwill.

The only way to protect children at school is with armed personnel and those who can be armed at a moment’s notice, a school militia of sorts, how ironic. The banning of bump stocks, age requirements, and high capacity magazine restrictions will do absolutely nothing to protect children at the point of attack. There are ways to very easily overcome all of these useless laws in order to inflict as many casualties as possible. We live in a different world now. Disaffected former students and jilted boyfriends are not the only threat out there. No law can protect the school children from your run-of-the-mill terrorists. What then? Will Liberals squeal about terrorist control? Yes, we must protect the children, but it is clear we can’t count on Liberals to cooperate in that endeavor.",2019-08-08T04:52:00+0000,The Most Perfect Union,0,99,1000,4999,0.028694,Arizona,0.007174,New Mexico,0.01901,Louisiana,0.006456,Maine,0.007891,Maryland,0.012912,Minnesota,0.00538,Montana,0.010043,Nebraska,0.010043,Nevada,0.003945,New Hampshire,0.009326,New Jersey,0.02439,New York,0.014347,Kansas,0.004663,North Dakota,0.048422,Ohio,0.026542,Oklahoma,0.017217,Oregon,0.041607,Pennsylvania,0.004663,South Dakota,0.005739,Utah,0.002869,Vermont,0.011478,West Virginia,0.016499,Wisconsin,0.022956,Kentucky,0.033357,Illinois,0.050574,California,0.039813,Tennessee,0.053085,Florida,0.031205,Indiana,0.011836,Iowa,0.007174,Massachusetts,0.035151,Michigan,0.017217,Mississippi,0.031205,Missouri,0.034792,North Carolina,0.001435,Rhode Island,0.01901,South Carolina,0.090746,Texas,0.009326,Idaho,0.030488,Virginia,0.021521,Washington,0.026542,Alabama,0.004663,Alaska,0.024749,Arkansas,0.015065,Colorado,0.006815,Connecticut,0.001793,Delaware,0.031564,Georgia,0.003587,Hawaii,0.005022,Wyoming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We’re All Enemies of the State: Draconian Laws, Precrime & the Surveillance State | By John W. Whitehead

If the government is consistent about any one thing, it is this: it has an unnerving tendency to exploit crises and use them as opportunities for power grabs under the guise of national security. 

Cue the Emergency State, the government’s Machiavellian version of crisis management that justifies all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security. Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, “unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters”: the government has been anticipating and preparing for such crises for years now. It’s all part of the grand plan for total control.

The government’s proposed response to the latest round of mass shootings—red flag gun laws, precrime surveillance, fusion centers, threat assessments, mental health assessments, involuntary confinement—is just more of the same. 

It’s a simple enough formula: first, you create fear, then you capitalize on it by seizing power. For instance, in his remarks on the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, President Trump promised to give the FBI “whatever they need” to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism. Let that sink in a moment. In a post-9/11 America, Trump’s promise bodes ill for whatever remnants of freedom we have left. With that promise, flippantly delivered without any apparent thought for the Constitution’s prohibitions on such overreach, the president has given the FBI the green light to violate Americans’ civil liberties in every which way.

"We’re All Enemies of the State: Draconian Laws, Precrime & the Surveillance State | By John W. Whitehead

If the government is consistent about any one thing, it is this: it has an unnerving tendency to exploit crises and use them as opportunities for power grabs under the guise of national security. 

Cue the Emergency State, the government’s Machiavellian version of crisis management that justifies all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security. Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, “unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters”: the government has been anticipating and preparing for such crises for years now. It’s all part of the grand plan for total control.

The government’s proposed response to the latest round of mass shootings—red flag gun laws, precrime surveillance, fusion centers, threat assessments, mental health assessments, involuntary confinement—is just more of the same. 

It’s a simple enough formula: first, you create fear, then you capitalize on it by seizing power. For instance, in his remarks on the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, President Trump promised to give the FBI “whatever they need” to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism. Let that sink in a moment. In a post-9/11 America, Trump’s promise bodes ill for whatever remnants of freedom we have left. With that promise, flippantly delivered without any apparent thought for the Constitution’s prohibitions on such overreach, the president has given the FBI the green light to violate Americans’ civil liberties in every which way.

"AN IMPORTANT AND TIMELY MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:

""Michelle and I grieve with all the families in El Paso and Dayton who endured these latest mass shootings. 

Even if details are still emerging, there are a few things we already know to be true.

First, no other nation on Earth comes close to experiencing the frequency of mass shootings that we see in the United States. 

No other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do. 

Every time this happens, we’re told that tougher gun laws won’t stop all murders; that they won’t stop every deranged individual from getting a weapon and shooting innocent people in public places. 

But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings. 

They can save some families from heartbreak. 

We are not helpless here. 

And until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening.

Second, while the motivations behind these shootings may not yet be fully known, there are indications that the El Paso shooting follows a dangerous trend: troubled individuals who embrace racist ideologies and see themselves obligated to act violently to preserve white supremacy. 

Like the followers of ISIS and other foreign terrorist organizations, these individuals may act alone, but they’ve been radicalized by white nationalist websites that proliferate on the internet. 

That means that both law enforcement agencies and internet platforms need to come up with better strategies to reduce the influence of these hate groups.

But just as important, all of us have to send a clarion call and behave with the values of tolerance and diversity that should be the hallmark of our democracy. 

We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don’t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people. 

Such language isn’t new – it’s been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history, here in America and around the world. 

It is at the root of slavery and Jim Crow, the Holocaust, the genocide in Rwanda and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. 

It has no place in our politics and our public life. 

And it’s time for the overwhelming majority of Americans of goodwill, of every race and faith and political party, to say as much – clearly and unequivocally.""

And to his words, I can only add: AMEN!

"It's been a minute, so much has happened, #Democrats and liberals under Donald J. Trump are behaving the same as #republicans and #conservatives did under #Obama. Plus #foxnews is defending Trump as not a racist, #cnn is claiming he is. Previous video of Trump laughing about the #maga crew encouraging shooting Hispanics is not playing well. And Trump and conservatives are still attacking Obama and blanming him for white supremacists and home grown terrorists, I mean it can't be Trump's rhetoric right? Lowest unemployment ever!  RIP to the Americans murdered this past weekend. Was anyone surprised if the American terrorist manifesto? Of course they received many thoughts and prayers, with blame being placed on mental health (more shame and judgement on the autistic), and #Republicans favorite ploy to not talk about background checks and better gun regulation.... video games. Republicans won't take your guns, and they want smaller government unless it's in the best interest of religion, telling woman what to do with their body or your video games....

"Another week, another round of white supremacist terror attacks. We mourn the dead in El Paso and Dayton, and dread the inevitable news of the next attack. Another similar sounding manifesto, another Frankenstein document remixing the most atrocious genocidal rhetoric pulled from the darkest corners of the internet, alt-right 'white genocide' fear mongering, and a conservative party in the United States that has traded dog-whistle racism for a bull-horn and brazen calls that radicalize and enduce terrorist violence.

How did we get here? Like many of the issues I talk about, we must recognize there is a deep historical analysis we must turn to understand the evil violence that is occurring around us. White supremacist terrorism has escalated and become emboldened by Trump, but it is also, if I may be a cynical realist, as American as apple pie. The triplet forces of capitalism, patriarchy, and colonialism inform the events we are witnessing today. Mostly young white men, alienated by the cultural decay of late stage capitalism and social mores that reinforce the notion that they should be at the top of the social hierarchy, create a cultural powder keg that leads to literal, physical death and mayhem.

There is no easy ""policy fix"" for this. While robust education programs for white working people to expose them to analysis like that in this video would do much to fight back against white supremacist brainwashing, the best answer is more intimate. 

Talk to the young white men in your lives (especially and particularly white people). Have the tough conversations. Do everything you possibly can to make sure they do not begin treading down a bleak, hateful path.

"WHO VETTED TRUMP'S CANDIDATE FOR AMERICA'S TOP INTELLIGENCE POST? Apparently, no one until Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, scrutinized Trump's nominee. When Trump countered that he relied on the press, not the White House, to do his vetting, NotWe.org linked the Senator's statement to WeAreIndignant.com

Senator Feinstein wrote: ""This isn’t a learn-as-you-go position and shouldn’t be given out to political supporters.""  After he withdrew Ratcliffe's nomination, Trump contended that he had put the Congressman's name 'out there' because he relied on the press to do his vetting in order ""to save money"" for the Government. Trump's quote ""I give out a name to the press, and they vet for me,"" invited ridicule from a number of the reporters Trump has long derided for inventing 'fake news'. 

CNN journalist Max Boot' summarized this vetting debacle, saying: ""The Director of National Intelligence was a post that was created after 9/11 to prevent another attack on the American homeland. This is one of the most important jobs in the US Government, but Trump gave less attention and less foresight to choosing a nominee than he would to choosing an interior decorator for Mar-a-Lago.""

The Director of National Intelligence is required by law to be someone with “extensive national security expertise.”  Ratcliffe had published on his House website that he developed his personal expertise when, as a prosecutor, he tried suspects accused of funneling money to the Hamas terrorist group. Seemingly the White House accepted his resume without inquiry. Only after an aide came forward and reported that when he was a US Attorney Ratcliffe had investigated only tangentially related issues and had never prosecuted any terrorist cases did Trump ask Ratcliffe to withdraw his name from nomination.",2019-08-03T06:53:20+0000,Aldis Browne,0,99,1000,4999,0.007855,Maine,0.018068,Oregon,0.004713,Montana,0.00707,Nebraska,0.010212,Nevada,0.003928,New Hampshire,0.019639,New Jersey,0.007855,New Mexico,0.033778,New York,0.029065,North Carolina,0.05813,Ohio,0.017282,Oklahoma,0.036135,Pennsylvania,0.00707,Mississippi,0.003928,Rhode Island,0.015711,South Carolina,0.002357,South Dakota,0.023566,Tennessee,0.062058,Texas,0.007855,Utah,0.000786,Vermont,0.021995,Virginia,0.029065,Washington,0.011783,West Virginia,0.044776,Missouri,0.012569,Minnesota,0.000786,North Dakota,0.075412,Florida,0.000786,"Washington, District of Columbia",0.000786,Wyoming,0.019639,Alabama,0.003928,Alaska,0.027494,Arizona,0.012569,Arkansas,0.069128,California,0.013354,Colorado,0.008641,Connecticut,0.003928,Delaware,0.015711,Georgia,0.054203,Michigan,0.003928,Hawaii,0.00707,Idaho,0.039277,Illinois,0.027494,Indiana,0.020424,Iowa,0.011783,Kansas,0.029851,Kentucky,0.013354,Louisiana,0.011783,Maryland,0.011783,Massachusetts,0.019639,Wisconsin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Regarding Trump's stated plan to declare ""Antifa"" a terrorist Organization:

- 'Antifa' is not an organization; nobody belongs to it, there are no membership rolls. So you cannot prove you do NOT belong to it.

- If you have shown up to a protest, if you have been in a picture showing you were near a protest, if you have offered first aid at a political demonstration or shown up as clergy support or carried a sign or made a Facebook post or LIKED a post saying you're against fascism, you *could* be accused of being a ""member of Antifa"".. You can't prove it's not true.

- If this measure to declare #Antifa ""domestic terrorists"" passes, that means you and I can be arrested and prosecuted as ""domestic terrorists."" No, really, you too.

- We passed a bunch of laws and rulings back in 2002 or so declaring that accused terrorists don't get due process, and can be held indefinitely without trial, tortured, and so on. Would they actually DO that? Look at thte immigrant camps and ask again.

- We have a whole bunch of new for-profit detention camps for holding people in indefinitely without trial, where people are dying right now from nightmarish conditions

- The Trump administration also just declared that they're opening up the death penalty for federal crimes, like terrorism, for the first time in years.

- ICE is running around right now, without badges or uniforms or warrants, disappearing people--including US citizens--and locking them up. Fully half their agents belonged to a Facebook group where they shared racist jokes, bragged about the violence they'd done to the subhuman animals they're locking up, and talked about how they wanted to assault and rape political figures they don't like.

- This move is a license to lock up (and execute?) political dissenters and community organizers without due process and the pieces have all been put in place to use it.

In the US, we're not supposed to imprison people for what they think. 

Being in the KKK is not a crime, but Trump wants to make it illegal to be involved with any group that criticizes him! (Remember he has already declared Comey and Mueller to be *Treasonous* for having committed no crime but investigating him)

"What is a Cold War? The anticipation of a Hot War

The latest conference of Luxembourg Forum took place in Rome on June 04-05 and has brought together the most competent experts, the heads of five major international organizations engaged in studying nuclear arms control issues, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, Global Zero, Российский совет по международным делам - РСМД, and James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies - CNS.

Can the North Korea sell nuclear wares to terrorist groups?
What are the perspectives of the situation with Iran and its nuclear program?
Is there a risk that nuclear material can fall into the hands of non-state actors?
Is the Third World War possible and can an agreement between the US and Russia be reached in the context of quite intense political confrontation?

Watch the video and you’ll get answers to these and many other questions and will know the opinion of many leading world experts.

Participants of the International Luxembourg Forum conference in Rome met with the Vatican Secretary of State his eminence  Cardinal Pietro Parolin as part of the dialogue and joint initiatives between the Luxembourg Forum and the Holy See.

Viatcheslav Kantor, President of the Luxembourg Forum: “The idea that’s especially close to my heart is that we have forgotten how to negotiate in principle, we are not prepared to hear each other, I mean Russia and the United States. We don’t understand that to say no to each other is a deconstructive position.”

William Perry, former US Secretary of Defense: “It appears that the Trump administration intends to let New START expire in 2020, rather than extend it, or negotiate a follow on treaty. If that happens, there will be, for the first time in almost fifty years, no agreed limit on nuclear weapons; and there will be no bilateral talks underway on how to limit nuclear dangers. This has become the new normal for arms control treaties, which I call the new abnormal, and it has happened in just two years.

Joan Rohlfing, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Nuclear Threat Initiative: “We need to change the way we think about the risks of nuclear use. We have new risks and new problems but old thinking. The burden of change starts with us.”

"FROM THE PRISON SYSTEM TO THE STREET, GANGS ARE TAKING OVER AMERICA -- THE NUMBER OF GANG MEMBERS IN PRISON IS UNKNOWN

A prison gang is an inmate organization that starts its operattions within a prison system, that has a corporate entity, exists into perpetuity, and whose membership is restrictive, mutually exclusive, and often requires a lifetime commitment -- or death. In ""The Social Order of the Underworld: How Prison Gangs Govern the American Penal System,"" the author David Skarbek argues the emergence of prison gangs are due to the dramatic increase in the prison population and inmate's demand for safety. 

As the gang phenomenon has grown and spread in America's cities and counties, there has been a parallel growth and spread of gangs inside America's prisons. There's no way to know how many prisons have gang member inmates because there are no statistics. 

Here are just a few Hispanic gangs:

The barbaric, animalistic narco-terrorist MS-13 gang began inside the Los Angeles prison systems and mushroomed into one of the most deadly U.S. gangs controlled out of El Salvador's inmates.  

MEXICAN MAFIA

The Mexican Mafia began in a California prison and spread throughout the Southwestern U.S.The Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood are allies and work together to control prostitution, drug running, weapons and ""hits"" or murders. Originally formed in the 1950s in California prisons by Hispanic prisoners from the southern part of that state, Eme has traditionally been composed of US-born or raised Hispanics and has retained ties to the Southern California-based ""Sureños"". During the 1970s and 1980s, Eme in California established the model of leveraging their power in prison to control and profit from criminal activity on the street.

NUESTRA FAMILIA

Nuestra Familia (""our family"" in Spanish):(Red) The ""N"" is the 14th letter in the alphabet which is used as their symbol along with the Roman numeral ""XIV"" to represent their gang; another mostly Hispanic prison gang that is constantly at war with La Eme and was originally formed from Northern-California or rural-based Hispanic prisoners with ties to ""Norteños"" of Northern California opposing the domination by La Eme (Mexican Mafia), which was started by and associated with Los Angeles gang members. The gang was first established in Soledad prison in California in the 1960s.

Now the gangs have taken over some of U.S. prisons and control their national criminal enterprises out of prison cells.

TEXAS SYNDICATE -- MOSTLY ILLEGAL ALIENS

The Texas Syndicate: A mostly Texas-based prison gang that includes mostly Hispanic members and does (albeit rarely) allow non-Hispanic Caucasian members. The Texas Syndicate, more than La Eme or Nuestra Familia, has been associated or allied with Mexican immigrant prisoners, while Eme and Familia tend to be composed of and associate with US-born or raised Hispanics.

NETAS PUERTO RICAN GANG

Ñetas: a Hispanic (mainly Puerto Rican) gang, found on Puerto Rico and on the eastern coast of the US. Originally formed in 1970 in the Río Piedras State Penitentiary, Puerto Rico.

Latin Kings, established in Chicago in 1954

Caucasian:  ARYAN BROTHERHOOD -- ALLIES OF THE MEXICAN MAFIA: 

A white prison gang that originated in California's San Quentin Prison amongst White American prisoners in 1964. Their emblem, ""the brand"", consists of a shamrock and the number 666. Other identifiers include the initials ""AB"", Swastikas and the sigrune.[10] Perhaps out of their ideology and the necessity of establishing a presence among the more numerous African American and Hispanic gang members, the AB has a particular reputation for ruthlessness and violence. Since the 1990s, in part because of this reputation, the AB has been targeted heavily by state and federal authorities. Many key AB members have been moved to ""supermax"" control-unit prisons at both the federal and state level or are under federal indictment.

"Ilhan Omar is a member of the Justice Democrats aka ""the squad"" of 4 female congress women who hate America.  Reportedly they have been supporting and sided with Hamas & Hezbollah, by actively promoting Legislation in Congress to Boycot Israel.

The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (also known as BDS) is a global campaign promoting various forms of boycott against Israel until it meets what the campaign describes as Israel's ""obligations under international law"", defined as withdrawal from the occupied territories.

BDS Supporters have allied themselves with Hamas & Hezbollah, both of which the American State Department has designated as a Terrorist Organizations, who seek to expel the Jewish people from Israel formerly know as Palestine.

Israel is a American Ally in the Middle East, along with Saudi Arabia.  

However, according to Osama Bin Laden, American support and protection of Israel, enabled Israel to occupy Palestine which the Muslims consider their holy land ie Mecca, and is the reason for Al Qaeda to declare Jihad against America, and was the pretext to the 9/11 Terrorist Attack.

The Justice Democrats have publicly announced their plans to install more Progressives aka Socialist/Communist/Anti-Americans who are hostile to Liberals and the Democratic Party, in addition to Republicans and America in General, on The Young Turks(TYT) youtube Channel.  https://youtu.be/uH8ndPqRHFc

Justice Democrats Stated Objective is to acquire legislative power from the Democratic Party at the Federal Level, in order to install more Communist and Socialist Legislation in the Congress, in order to corrupt and take over the Federal Government from the inside out, while aiding and abetting enemies abroad who are hostile to America and Americans, and their Allies.

Ilhan Omar, and the other Justice Democrats sworn into Congress have broken their Oath of Office.   

According to this statute, officials must “solemnly swear (or affirm)” that they “will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic”.  

Matthew 6:24 - No man can serve two masters: for either he. will hate the one, and love the other;

This is why McCarthyism was necessary to root out all Communist/Socialist within Government in 1950–1954.  Perhaps we need to purge communist from Government once again in 2019, https://youtu.be/8mvEnnHAa4Y.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism

In addition to purging Socialist/Communist domestically, Ilhan Omar along with the other Justice Democrats proven we are still in a global war with Jihadist in the War on Terrorism, and Hunt for WMDs.

"Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of AMERICA, as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks. Separately, TRUMP angered some American Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques:
 
IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT... Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans.  This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.

 We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language!

Most Americans believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools.  If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.

We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.

This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great AMERICAN freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.

If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country that accepted you.",2019-07-23T02:37:13+0000,America Strong,0,99,1000,4999,0.002064,Delaware,0.027864,Tennessee,0.006192,New Mexico,0.027864,New York,0.043344,North Carolina,0.049536,Ohio,0.031992,Oklahoma,0.04644,Pennsylvania,0.002064,Rhode Island,0.026832,South Carolina,0.00516,South Dakota,0.085655,Texas,0.01032,Nevada,0.0258,Virginia,0.016512,West Virginia,0.039216,Indiana,0.011352,Kansas,0.007224,Maine,0.009288,Massachusetts,0.008256,Nebraska,0.008256,Utah,0.014448,Washington,0.009288,New Jersey,0.035088,Missouri,0.002064,Hawaii,0.01548,Arkansas,0.004128,Connecticut,0.00516,Montana,0.004128,North Dakota,0.01548,Oregon,0.004128,Iowa,0.00516,Vermont,0.001032,Wyoming,0.037152,Alabama,0.028896,Arizona,0.05676,California,0.021672,Mississippi,0.01032,Colorado,0.054696,Florida,0.028896,Georgia,0.004128,Idaho,0.0258,Illinois,0.03096,Kentucky,0.019608,Louisiana,0.006192,Maryland,0.049536,Michigan,0.01032,Minnesota,0.008256,Wisconsin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly one third of the worlds oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz. Iran is located on the north side of the smallest section of the Strait. Hostility flowing out of Iran is threatening economies around the world. America has the duty to take down Iran's evil terrorist funding regime if they do not science and desist their nuclear program and conclude their mass sposorship of terrorism around the world.,2019-07-20T02:56:06+0000,Not Liberal News,0,99,0,999,0.031915,Alabama,0.031915,North Carolina,0.026596,Louisiana,0.010638,Maryland,0.010638,Mississippi,0.005319,Nebraska,0.010638,Nevada,0.010638,New Jersey,0.021277,New York,0.005319,Oklahoma,0.010638,Kansas,0.010638,Oregon,0.005319,South Carolina,0.010638,South Dakota,0.037234,Virginia,0.015957,West Virginia,0.005319,Delaware,0.015957,Maine,0.005319,North Dakota,0.015957,Kentucky,0.021277,Illinois,0.047872,Arizona,0.053191,Ohio,0.037234,California,0.053191,Florida,0.005319,Idaho,0.042553,Indiana,0.021277,Massachusetts,0.058511,Michigan,0.026596,Missouri,0.010638,Montana,0.069149,Pennsylvania,0.037234,Georgia,0.042553,Tennessee,0.06383,Texas,0.015957,Washington,0.026596,Wisconsin,0.010638,Alaska,0.031915,Arkansas,0.015957,Colorado,0.005319,Connecticut,0.005319,Rhode Island,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When Luis Alvarez gave his badge to Mitch McConnell, it sealed the Senator’s promise - to bring the bill that would later be named for Luis to a vote on the Senate Floor.

Luis won’t see that vote. And instead of spending his last weeks with his family, he traveled to D.C. to testify in front of Congress and lobby for this bill's passage. 

Now that the 9/11 VCF has passed the House, we need Mitch McConnell to keep his promise, talk to fellow Kentuckian Rand Paul, and #Renew911VCF.

Please sign here to help me urge Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul to do what’s right by the heroes and survivors of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We must pass this bill. It is our moral obligation.

Please sign and share.
