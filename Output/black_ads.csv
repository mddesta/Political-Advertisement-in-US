"ARTUR DAVIS IS LACKING IN CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY!
Artur Davis not only voted against Obamacare, but he voted with the corporate Republicans the vast majority of the time, even though he was a Democrat representing Alabama Congressional District 7, which included the Black Belt.

What Artur Davis tried to do to the Democratic Party's major issues, and the first Black President of the US, in a failed attempt get elected Governor of Alabama, demonstrated his basic flaws in his character! After Davis had receive total support from President and Mrs. Obama and 90% of the Democrats in Alabama, he voted against the President's signature issue, ""Obamacare."" If his vote had prevailed, it would have had ramifications for generations to come. Not only would it have resulted in the death of 562 poor people a year in the state of Alabama, but it may have resulted in a failed Presidency of the first Black President. The image would have eroded the hopes, dreams, confidence and aspirations of young Black boys and girls for generations in America.

After the President’s Health Care Plan was approved by one vote, and the Democrats solidly rejected Artur Davis’ bid for Governor, Artur Davis still on his mission to destroy President Obama and the Party, went to the Republican National Convention. He boldly declared his support for Mitt Romney for President in an effort to ensure President Obama would go down in history as a failed Presidency! Artur Davis failed again because of the same reason, lack of integrity. After the Republicans discorded him like a used condom, he returned to Montgomery to continue his deceit by attempting to con the people again in the Mayoral Race. WE MUST AGAIN SHOW HIM THE ROAD",2019-08-21T04:08:28+0000,Zacchaeus Buckner,0,99,0,999,1,Alabama,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"From APT's president, Dr. Charles Jacobs.

""Al Sharpton is betraying black people currently enslaved in Africa. He went there. He spoke to them. He promised the slaves he met that he would awaken American blacks to their plight, but then he abandoned them. He abandoned them, I believe, because they are enslaved by Arab Muslims.

"“On this date 400 years ago “20 and odd negars,” arrived at Port Comfort in the English colony of Virginia, the first documented enslaved Africans in the North American English colonies. Today, in proud and stubborn spite of 10,000 obituaries, African America lives, irrefutable proof of the heights mankind can scale out of the depths of horror, a testament to the African personality’s almighty conjuring power, which forged out of the stolen strands of dozens of  nationalities, a new nation, a singular people, a novel path through the perils of human history, blazing itself toward the triumphant and final victory of human freedom.”

"After losing the last 4 debates—and even getting up and walking out of the African American Alliance forum after losing so badly—Luke Bronin has canceled the only televised Democratic Primary Debate on Fox 61. 

Today, Bronin shows his contempt for the 10,000 Hartford Democrats that signed our petitions to primary against him on September 10. 

The people of our neighborhoods want an open, televised debate on how to strengthen Hartford’s schools, clean up our neighborhoods, and create good paying jobs for our residents. Bronin clearly doesn’t want to debate candidates with deep Hartford roots again because we will continue to show just how out of touch he is with the people of our neighborhoods.

WE KNOW he only shows up in our neighborhoods during campaign season, and it is unacceptable that Bronin won’t answer questions about his failed record of closing schools and libraries (and even a park!).

"WHY THE BATTLE BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT, BORDER PATROL AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS NOW MORE OF AN ARMS RACE THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY.  IT'S THE ARRIVAL OF SYNTHETIC DRUGS THAT HAS CHANGED DRUG TRAFFICKING FOREVER.

The New World of Synthetic Drugs Has Changed Drug Trafficking Forever.  

Synthetic man-made highs could dissolve the border issues and transform the global drug trade.  These man-made highs include well-known banned substances such as methamphetamine, MDMA, LSD, and ketamine; a vast array of new psychoactive substances (NPS) including cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids; black market medicines such as fentanyl and tranquilizers, and dangerous or impure analogues and substitutes of the above.

WHY?  THEY CAN BE MADE ANYWHERE CHEAPER FOR MORE PROFIT

Manufactured anywhere, from DIY bathroom labs to huge chemical factories, synthetic drugs are cheaper and easier to make than cocaine and heroin because there is no reliance on the cultivation of plants. Factories can pivot from making one drug to another—including the legal precursor chemicals used in banned substances—in days, quickly adapting to market demand. Because of the way they are produced and trafficked, they can be made, shipped and consumed in a relative instant and are more affordable for both suppliers and customers.

Thomas Pietschmann, a drug trend analyst at the U.N.’s Office of Drugs and Crime, said “the most marked increase in the drugs seized over the past two decades has clearly been in synthetic drugs.” He added that while the global popularity of cannabis means that plant-based drugs are still way more prevalent than synthetics, seizures of lab-formed substances have skyrocketed compared with drugs derived from plants.

Peter Andreas, a professor of international studies at Brown University and the author of Border Games: Policing the U.S.-Mexico Divide, put it more simply: “The future is synthetic.” Andreas said this will have all sorts of repercussions for border controls.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

    MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered https://t.co/gRJZqDmGZ0

    — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"SAD...BUT TRUE.

From the article:

'President Donald Trump, his enablers in Congress and his most devoted supporters are anti-American and soft on terrorism.

...It would appear that Trump and his sycophantic fascists-in-training simply don’t like black Americans, and do not consider predominantly black cities as part of the “real America.” 

Shocking news, no doubt, for anyone who has spent the majority of their days in a coma, but it makes lectures on patriotism from people who so clearly hate so much of their own country particularly vomitous.'

"Anthony Scaramucci Reveals The Last Straw
William Southold | Opinion Columnist |The Southold Report
“Speaking fiction to power one story at a time.”
Veritas Per Ficta!

Donald Trump attacked Anthony Scaramucci (again) on Twitter this morning, just as I was finishing this story you are reading now. I had tracked Scaramucci down this weekend at Tate’s Bake Shop in Southampton. I had gotten the word that he was crazy for their in season, fresh picked raspberry scones, and why wouldn’t he be, I was chowing down on one when I saw him come through the door.

I gave him time to make his order and sit down before I approached him, and asked for a word. He took one look at his phone and shut it down before he looked up and said, “Sure, have a seat. I know you.”

I don’t know which surprised me more, the fact that he knew me, or the fact that he graciously allowed me to join him. It was early, and we were the only two seated on the far side, furthest from the counter.

“I know you,” he repeated, “I’ve seen you around D.C. Tell me your name again.”

I did, and he responded, “Oh, yeah, the Fake News guy.”

“None other.""

“Hey, you know I was once a Fake HouseGuest on Celebrity Big Brother 2.”

“Celebrity Big Brother . . .?”

“A show I was on once. It was a blast. You didn’t see it. That’s OK. So what can I do for you Mr. Fake News Guy?”

“Well,” I said, trying to get right to it, “you’ve been all over the news lately, encouraging people . . .”

“To think for themselves” he cut me off. “We are in a terrible fix, our country of ours, and we need to do something about it. Quickly. Bigly, as my old but briefest of bosses might have said it.”

He sounded hopped up on coffee, but there was no food or drink in front of him.

“I’ve heard you’re working with Bill Kristol, to come up with a challenger to your once brief boss,” I said.

Just then the waitress brought his order over. Yep, raspberry scone. Nailed it!

“Thank you, Margaret. Looks great,” he told her.

“Always is,” she said, and turned and left.

“You know, it’s always important to thank your service people, by name. By name,” he repeated. They don’t always stay as waitresses, or whatever. People need recognition! They need to know when they are doing their job well.  That's how you get better service.  Now, what were we talking about? I gotta tell ya, I come in here to work, so . . .” hands extended, palms up, phone at the ready, with a little shrug.

I took it as intended, to bring our brief conversation to an end.

“So any comment on Kristol?” I asked him, making ready to get up.

“Something’s gotta be done, I can tell you that, and Kristol’s a man who can pull it all together.

He paused a moment, in thought. “You know, everybody thought I got fired because of my profanity laced tirade. The truth is, I wanted out. Do you know what was the last thing Trump asked me to do?”

“You mean before you . . . left as Communication Director?

“Yeah. The big guy could tell things were goin’ south with his Black Outreach” he liked to call it. He calls me into the Oval, and shows me this gold plated statue he had made. Says right on it, World’s Least Racist Person EVER!.

“He had a statue of himself, World’s Least Racist . . . “

“Yeah, you got it. He told me I had to find a Black celebrity, he wanted Iron Mike, or Dennis Rodman, or Kanye, that’s who he really wanted. He told me to find one of them, and tell them to present him with this statue. Like it was their idea.”

“That’s a little . . . bold.”

“Ya think? It’s bull goose looney! I said Boss, he used to like me to call him Boss, I said you can’t ask someone else to lie for you. You gotta go at it straight. There must be plenty of celebs willing to come out for you over racism. And he says, no, this is the way. It’s gotta be big. We can do the whole thing in the Rose Garden, it’s gotta be the gold plated statue.”

“I say, but it’s all a big lie you’re trying to pull off, you want someone to go on the record with your lie, and he says, Mooch, you know it’s my way or the highway around here. You get that much don’t you?”

“That was his response?”

“The Big Lie, the bigger the better. People need to stop putting up with it. I called him on it. He doesn’t like that one bit. Next thing I know, I got canned.”

“So, can I quote you on this?”

“Sure. Quote me all you want. People need to know this stuff. It’s time to pull the plug on this nut job.”

I left Mr. Scaramucci to his coffee and scone, and was working on this story when Trump unleashed his latest attack dog tweet on the Mooch. So, that’s the story at this hour. It’s bound to change, though. It’s about Trump.

"It's World Humanitarian Day AND #MemberMonday — Clara Luper seemed like the obvious fit. 

During her 41 years as an award-winning Oklahoma educator, Luper taught history and made history. She grew up in Okfuskee County (near Hoffman) and went on to receive her Bachelor of Arts degree from Langston University and her master's degree from The University of Oklahoma. 

Luper is known as the mother of the civil rights movement. In 1958, she coordinated the first publicized sit-in in the nation at the Katz Drug Store lunch counter in Oklahoma City. Thanks to her persistence and patience, Katz desegregated the lunch counters in each of its 38 stores. 

""I knew I was right, because somewhere I read in the 14th Amendment that I was a citizen and I had rights, and I had the right to eat. Within that hamburger was the whole essence of democracy. If you could deny me the right to eat, you could deny me the right to live or work where I want."" — Clara Luper

This month is also the 50th anniversary of the OKC Sanitation Strike, where more than 200 Black sanitation workers went on strike, citing poor working conditions, pay and racist treatment. Luper was instrumental in leading this movement.

"When her father became president in 1977, nine-year-old Amy Carter moved from her home in Georgia to the White House in the middle of the school year. She started at Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School, a few blocks from the White House, making her the first president’s child to attend a local public school since Quentin Roosevelt. 

Her new teacher, Verona Meeder, had just the thing to help ease Amy’s transition. Verona’s dog had given birth to a litter of puppies on the night Jimmy Carter was elected President of the United States. Because of their serendipitous birth, she promised one of the Border Collie mix puppies to Amy Carter and delivered him to the White House after her first day of school.

The black-and-white puppy was dubbed “Grits.” This was probably a play on the campaign slogan “Grits and Fritz in ’76,” which referred to President Carter’s southern roots and his running mate Walter Mondale’s nickname. 

Grits quickly became popular with both the first family and the press. Newspapers reported that Amy was “ecstatic” with her new friend. He joined her on sleepovers in her treehouse on the South Lawn. The nonprofit Voice for Animals Society officially dubbed him the “first canine.”

Grits even got involved in a bit of charity work. Dr. Stephen Melman, a D.C.-area veterinarian, enlisted the first dog to help promote a heartworm prevention drive. They posed for photos on the South Lawn to encourage dog owners to take their pets for preventative screenings.

After two and a half years in the White House, Grits eventually returned to live with Mrs. Meeder, who had recently lost her own dog.

In this photograph, Amy Carter poses with Grits on the White House steps.

"This evening, I attended the unveiling of a historical marker here in Durham which honored the establishment of the Algonquin Tennis Club in 1922. This club was established during the days of segregation to give African American tennis enthusiasts a place to play a favorite sport as well as to socialize and strategize. The land for the club was purchased in 1934, and the building where the club was housed provided a dining room as well as guest rooms for black tourists visiting Durham. The club hosted tournaments and exhibition matches for Black athletes such as Althea Gibson and Arthur Ash, both of whom became recognized worldwide as accomplished tennis players. The club was also the place where Black political activists came together to establish the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People in 1935. The Durham Committee continues today to provide leadership in our community and to advocate for progressive values and equal opportunity for all. It was great to attend this beautiful ceremony.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

    — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"DIY Decor | Fall Welcome Door Mat

Add a little spice to your pumpkins this fall with this door mat. 

👉 Declutter to make room for DIY projects like this one by scheduling a free donation pickup of your gently used clothes, shoes and household items! Visit ➡️ http://bit.ly/donatepupd340

✅ What You’ll need:

* Cricut Explore/Silhouette cutting machine or stencil
* Heavy cardstock 
* Plain doormat 
* Fabric paint 
* Stencil brush
* Painter's tape
* Gloves (optional)
* Black and white buffalo plaid rug

✅ Let’s Begin:

1. Arrange your stencil on the doormat using painter's tape to secure.
2. Use paint and stencil brush to paint inside the image. Wear gloves because you will need to use your fingers to hold down some sides!
3. Peel off the vinyl stencil right away to reveal the finished project. You don’t want to leave the stencil on there for very long otherwise the cardstock might stick to the mat. You can fill in any spots with a black sharpie or more paint with a small brush.
4. Let dry for 24-to-48 hours before placing outside (in case it rains – fabric paint needs time to dry completely before becoming waterproof).

PS -- Don't forget that when you schedule your free donation pickup today (for a later date) you'll be helping America's veterans! 🇺🇸 To get started, just click here >>> http://bit.ly/donatepupd340

"Our society and our economy demand so much of women — but they place a particular burden on Black, Latina, Native American, and other women of color. In 2017, Black women were paid 61 cents for every dollar white men made. Native women made 58 cents to a white man’s dollar — and Latinas earned just 53 cents to a white man’s dollar. And in the workplace, Black and Brown women are disproportionately mistreated. In a recent survey, nearly two-thirds of Black and Latina women reported experiencing racial discrimination at work. Even though Black women and Latinas are often the leaders and decision-makers in their own homes and communities, they hold only one spot on the Fortune 500 CEO list and less than 5% of Fortune 500 Board positions. 

That’s why I have a new plan: a set of executive actions I will take on day one of the Warren administration to boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve. I will deny contracting opportunities to companies with poor track records on diversity and equal pay.

"ANDY TAGGART SPEAKS POTUS (VIDEO): So, yesterday we saw another instance of the media carrying out its own agenda  only this time it was from from Paul Gallo on his SuperTalk Mississippi radio show. I respect Paul, have a good relationship with Paul and have been on his show many times. (And I hope to do so in the future.) He brings much needed discourse to our political process.That said, Republicans like to accuse ""the liberal media"" of bias so isn't it only fair that when that bias shows up in ""conservative media"" they be called out, too? (And you wonder why the approval rating of the media is as low as Congress.) This is from the debate with Andy Taggart and Mark Baker which Ms. Fitch refused to appear in (even though it was re-arranged for her schedule). You get to see it in his own words and from his lips, not some edited 40 character tweet from 3 yrs ago summarized by a radio host. Ronald Reagan's 80/20 rule (voting w/ me 80% of the time as opposed to 100% means you're my friend not my enemy) is well known.  Reasonable people, ie, Mississippi voters, know that you don't see eye-to-eye on everything, even though the media establishment would have you believe otherwise. An Attorney General is required to apply the Constitution and the laws and must use independent judgement in carrying out the job.  Andy Taggart owns that fact.  Any lawyer worth his or her salt will tell you that fact. Why? Because the law, and life, are not black and white (or red and blue); step into a courtroom in our judicial system (set up by our Founders) and you will see this fact. And make no mistake, the AG must have those courtroom skills to represent you, me and every other Mississippian. I have faith, as I am sure Andy Taggart does, that the voters know when they are being played and when they aren't. So, take a look.

"Black Restaurant Week is true Detroit Restaurant Week. Founder Kwaku Osei-Bonsu started BRW three years ago to highlight black-owned and operated restaurants in Detroit, many of whom have been holding down the dining scene long before the words ‘revival’ or ‘renew’ were on anyone’s tongue. They just were and still are IT.

The excitement kicks of next Tuesday, August 20 with a series of events leading into the weekend, including #SoulSolSole and #CannabisEdition.

"Our society and our economy demand so much of women — but they place a particular burden on Black, Latina, Native American, and other women of color. In 2017, Black women were paid 61 cents for every dollar white men made. Native women made 58 cents to a white man’s dollar — and Latinas earned just 53 cents to a white man’s dollar. And it’s getting worse: the gap in weekly earnings between white and Black women is higher today than it was forty years ago.

"BOSTON HERALD CALLS OUT WARREN FOR ‘DANGEROUS AND FALSE RHETORIC’ AGAINST POLICE, PAINTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CORRUPT AND RACIST.  

The editors of the Boston Herald are calling on 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to “stop using dangerous and false” rhetoric regarding law enforcement officers.  “Law enforcement is under assault in this country,” wrote the Herald’s editorial board. “Several ICE facilities have been attacked this year. On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff. Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

The Boston Herald urged that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “must stop using dangerous and false rhetoric immediately,” against police by painting law enforcement as hopelessly corrupt and racist. The paper argued this puts police in danger and cited law enforcement officials concerned about Warren’s rhetoric.

The Herald also specifically flagged its hometown senator for a tweet perpetuating the falsehood that teenager Michael Brown was “murdered” by police in Ferguson, Mo., even though according to the investigation into Brown’s case released during the Obama administration, “The unarmed 18-year-old black man’s shooting by a police officer was ruled an act of ‘self-defense’ by the U.S. Department of Justice. Witnesses corroborated the officer’s testimony that Brown was charging at him after already trying to wrestle away his gun,” the Herald wrote.

“The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote to Warren Tuesday saying her Friday tweet that black teen Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., was  ‘murdered by a white police officer’ is ‘appalling,’” the Herald noted.

The Herald’s accuracy was in contrast to national media networks like MSNBC and CNN, which DID NOT not correct Warren’s statement.

Former George W. Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, a prominent conservative, tweeted about the network silence, which was reported by The Washington Free Beacon: “MSNBC, CNN Ignore Warren and Harris Falsely Tweeting Michael Brown Was Murdered.”

    — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) August 13, 2019

The Herald noted that two Massachusetts police officers were murdered last year.

The Boston Herald editorial notes:

    Last year it was ICE she targeted for expulsion, saying that it should be replaced with “something that reflects our morality.” She bellowed to a boisterous Boston City Hall Plaza crowd that, “This is about children held in cages. This is about babies scattered all across this country.” [Emphasis added]

     Just days later, a Cambridge man offered to pay $500 to anyone who would kill an ICE agent. Law enforcement officers — the same ones Warren derides routinely — apprehended and charged the man. [Emphasis added]

“On Wednesday, six Philadelphia police officers were shot in the line of duty during a standoff,” The Boston Herald editors wrote. “Those same police also had to deal with being taunted by some bystanders, who laughed and yelled at them in the midst of the gunfire.”

Last year, police chiefs in Massachusetts denounced Warren for her comments at a predominantly black American college that police departments in the U.S. are racist.

“Let’s just start with the hard truth about our criminal justice system,” Warren said in August 2018. “It’s racist. It is. And when I say our system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.”

Since January, the Officer Down Memorial Page records that 73 law enforcement officers have died or been killed in the line of duty. Last year, more than 160 law enforcement officers died or were killed across the country.

"The mission of Indiana Minority Health Coalition (IMHC) is to eliminate health disparities through research, education, advocacy, and working to increase access to health care services in minority communities. We know that we can’t do this alone. Once again, we are reaching to our partners around the state who address chronic disease conditions to join us for our 23rd Minority Health Initiative Annual Luncheon (MHIAL) on September 17, 2019, 11:00 am – 1:30 pm at the Willows on Westfield, 6279 Westfield Blvd, Indianapolis, IN.
MHIAL 2019 Luncheon Theme
This year our theme is “Black Maternal Mortality: Framing the Problem; Finding Solutions.” Indiana has one of the nation’s worst rates of mothers dying while pregnant or within a year after giving birth. About 41 women in Indiana die per every 100,000 live births, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate is even worse for Black women. Some 53 Black Hoosier moms die for every 100,000 live births. That's on par with the maternal death rate in countries like Iraq and Vietnam, according to U.S. government statistics. A panel of experts will discuss both challenges and solutions and best practices being implemented. 
About the Minority Health Initiative Annual Luncheon (MHIAL)
MHIAL is Indiana’s largest activity held that focuses on how chronic disease, health disparities, and lack of affordable/accessible health care affect minorities.  MHIAL attracts approximately 300-500 attendees including representation from many of the state’s largest health care and insurance providers, state agencies, as well as, legislators and policy makers. There is also representation from IMHC’s 23 minority health coalitions from around the state.",2019-08-17T01:08:54+0000,,0,99,0,999,1,Indiana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
