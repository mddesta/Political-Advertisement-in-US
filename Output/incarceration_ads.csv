"Kent Williams has been granted early parole under #AB2942, a new California law which allows incarcerated persons to petition for and prosecutors to review old cases for which the prison terms were unjustly harsh. If warranted, they can recommend a new reduced sentence to the sentencing court. This two-step process resulted in the release of Williams after being incarcerated for nearly two decades.

Call us for legal help: 888-245-9393

California AB 2942 revised California Penal Code (PC) Section #1170 (d)(1). Under the revised law, DAs now have the right to reevaluate past sentences. If the DA determines that the length of the sentence no longer serves the interests of justice, then they may request resentencing for that inmate. A DA in the county in which the inmate was sentenced may bring the request to the county court.

If the court agrees to resentence the defendant, it will hold a resentencing hearing. It may provide a new sentence, as long as that term is shorter than the initial sentence.

What the Court Considers For a Recall:

When determining whether to recall a defendant’s sentence, the court can consider a wide range of factors, including an inmate’s behavior following conviction. Some of the factors the court may consider include: 1) An inmate’s record of rehabilitation while incarcerated 2) Whether there is evidence that the inmate’s risk of recidivism has been reduced 3) Evidence that circumstances have changed since the inmate was originally sentenced, such that continued incarceration does not serve justice.

A prosecuting agency can recommend a recall of sentence involving any type of offense, any type of sentence, and there are no requirements of time served.

What Will Happen During the Hearing?

If the court decides to hear your case and recall your sentence, the court will then hold a sentencing hearing as if you had not previously been sentenced. The court can then use all of its judicial powers available at the time of the resentencing hearing, including new authority to strike enhancements under recent reforms.

"Freedom University is proud to announce that it will incorporate the 1619 Project into our Fall 2019 Curriculum.

""The 1619 Project is a major initiative from The New York Times observing the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe the country’s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are.""

Freedom University will be incorporating several of the 1619 Project curriculum guides developed by the Pulitzer Center into our ""Bringing Human Rights Home: Rethinking U.S. History from a Human Rights Movement Perspective"" class. Taught by Professor Laura Emiko Soltis, this class will introduce undocumented students to the philosophy of universal human rights and the freedom struggles of marginalized and oppressed peoples on the land that is now the United States, from 1492 to the present. 

The 1619 Project will help us resituate 1619 as a pivotal moment in American history, and trace its influence not only on the institution of slavery, but on nearly every aspect of  history and modern life in the United States. 

Moreover, in this Freedom University class, we will expand upon the 1619 Project curriculum to help students investigate the intersections of Black and Brown history: namely, how the legacy of slavery has also influenced the creation of immigrant labor importation programs, race-based immigration quotas, and the modern immigrant detention and deportation system alongside the more visible historical trajectory of slavery in the African-American community through Black codes, convict leasing, Jim Crow, and mass incarceration. In tracing the influence of slavery on both Black and Brown communities, students will able to identify how powerful interests in the United States have been able to successfully create and recreate systems of oppression that accept the free and cheap labor of people of color while simultaneously denying their fundamental human rights. And most importantly, students will learn how people impacted by these systems have transformed their consciousness, organized resources, built coalitions, and mobilized to fight for their freedom as human beings with inherent dignity and rights. 

Here's to another semester of liberatory education!

"Lest we forget:
*Our murdered loved ones had one life  — One — Just like you. A life that they were entitled to live — a lifetime of adventure and love and family. Just like you. Their lives cannot be forgotten. The survivors will not let that happen — ever. Countless lifetimes were forever altered, destiny changed.
*They had names — 7000 plus names-just since 1980 — imagine the total. They had families — they had futures — they were human beings — they had dreams — Just like you. Their entire life, their futures, were painfully taken from them by the hand of another, intentionally, on purpose. Permanently — Never to be seen or heard again.
*Their killers took it all away — brutally and viciously — a horrendous way to die — Murder in the First Degree. They took a life — or more — that they had zero right to take. Their actions cannot be undone, they must be held accountable and responsible. Permanently — Just like their victims. 
*The 1074 adult inmates currently serving LWOP in Massachusetts cannot be allowed to harm again. They were already convicted of First Degree Murder in Massachusetts, defined as; A Premeditated Murder, A Felony Murder, A Homicide that is Exceptionally Brutal or Savage. The families of their victims would be fearful for the rest of their lives.
*The survivors have lived with and faced this evil everyday since the moment their loved ones took their last breath. Life is difficult after a murder in the family — to say the least. The thing about murder — It’s never over — as evidenced by these unconscionable bills. We are forced to fight the system for every ounce of “justice” — over and over and over again. When does it end?!

Shame on the legislators who introduced these bills Senator Joe Boncore @ 617-722-1634 (#1*) and Rep. Jay Livingstone @ 617-722-2013 (#2*). Opposition & Survivors Against Elimination of LWOP in MA. will Say No to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”. Please continue to call Judiciary members (#3*) and voice your opposition and/or email letters of opposition to James.McCarthy@mahouse.gov he will forward to all 17 members of the committee, hearing is not yet scheduled. Thank you! 

Because All Human beings brutally murdered deserve justice. Permanent justice not temporary justice. The justice that they and their families — the survivors — were guaranteed by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Court! 
Because Convicted First Degree Murderers do not deserve the second chance that they themselves denied to their own victims. 
Because Murder is Inhumane and We Demand Justice for Murder Victims.
Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers. Period.

"**Together we have Said NO to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”.  We have Said NO to Abolishing LWOP in Massachusetts! We have Said NO to Elimination of LWOP in Massachusetts! A sentence of LWOP means LWOP! Thank you all for your support!

Senator Joe Boncore NO longer supports his Senate Bill #826 (#1*). At our last meeting Boncore gave me his word as he shook my hand and his Chief of Staff Anthony Gesualdi has given me his promise that they will request the bill go to “study” where it will “die” along with Rep. Jay Livingstone House #3358 (#2*) as they are entwined and will receive the same fate. They assure me that they have the power - and “seniority” - to make this happen. They are awaiting a reply from the Judiciary on their request for a hearing date, I will update when hearing is scheduled.
The Judiciary Committee has received an overwhelming and just response from the survivors and citizens opposed to these unconscionable bills. We have spoken loud and clear! They have been bombarded with phone calls and letters opposing these outrageous bills. You may continue to call Judiciary members (#3*) and voice your opposition and/or email letters of opposition to James.McCarthy@mahouse.gov he will forward to all 17 members of the committee. 

These bills will be shut down...
Because All Human beings brutally murdered deserve justice. Permanent justice not temporary justice. The justice that they and their families — the survivors — were guaranteed by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Court! 
Because Convicted First Degree Murderers do not deserve the second chance that they themselves denied to their own victims. 
Because the Survivors and the citizens of Massachusetts will ensure Justice for Murder Victims continues in the Commonwealth.

Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers. Period.

United in our love of God and neighbor, we declare that the incarceration of children and their separation from their parents, as is currently occurring at our nation’s southern border, are a violation of the children’s human dignity and the teachings of the Christian faith. We call upon the leaders of our city, state, and country to take a stand against these immoral acts.

Rhonda’s unique perspective as both the “rehabilitated” and the “rehabilitator” gives her a special voice on criminal justice reform.

"**Please share - Please speak out - Please speak up - Please be brave for our brutally murdered loved ones - #LWOPstays
**I ask each of you: What is the value of a human life? What is the value of your child’s life? Our sons life was priceless and worth every dime it takes to keep his cold-blooded killer locked up — for life — every single dime! These legislators think our tax dollars shouldn’t be spent on keeping cold blooded killers locked up. They think First Degree Murderers should be our neighbors... How dare they...
**If you Oppose Elimination of Life Without Parole Retroactively for ALL 1074 convicted adult First Degree Murderers in Massachusetts please fight these unconscionable bills. Call or email all the Sponsors (#1+2*) and The Judiciary Commitee members (#3*) and help us shut these bills down! Thank you!

August 12th, 2019 Boston Herald article, (#4*), unfortunately there is no mention of Senator Joe Boncore — Petitioner of Senate Bill S.826 (#1*) — he needs to be called out as well! It is despicable what these legislators have done to the 70,000 plus survivors — the families, the friends, the witnesses — absolutely despicable. Forcing us to relive the murders of our loved ones — over and over and over — when we buried our loved ones it wasn’t the end — it was only the beginning... 

Notorious first-degree murderers have hope — hope that their victims nor the survivors will ever have. Disgusting...

“Notorious first-degree murderers — with legislators working for them — are pushing a Massachusetts bill that would abolish life-without-parole sentences, enraging families and friends who lost loved ones to killers.”
“Lifers led by Dirk Greineder, the Wellesley doctor who murdered his wife in 1999, promoted the concept. First-degree murderers would be retroactively eligible for parole hearings after 25 years under a bill introduced by state Rep. Jay Livingstone (D-Boston).”  
   And Senator Joe Boncore! 
“The Lifers’ Group Inc. at MCI-Norfolk and bill supporters on Beacon Hill argue that inmates can reform after decades, and show they’re deserving of returning to society.”
“Members of the Lifers’ Group recently wrote a model bill with advocates outside the prison, submitting it to Massachusetts legislators who adopted language to abolish life-without-parole.”
“Greineder, the Lifers’ Group vice chairman, helped write the prototype legislation with Nat Harrison and Lloyd Fillion — who are working with the Criminal Justice Policy Coalition on this effort.”

IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THESE KILLERS HAVE CHANGED — THEIR VICTIMS ARE STILL DEAD! The 1074 currently incarcerated adult First Degree Murderers must be held accountable for the brutal vicious killings that they committed and were convicted of by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Judicial Court. 
Permanently— just like their 7000 plus victims.

Greineder has mounted multiple failed appeals and is currently serving a life sentence for the brutal slaying of his wife of 30 years, Mabel, who was stabbed in her neck, head, and chest in a Wellesley park.
This is who our elected legislators are listening to — taking advice from — cold blooded killers...

Shame on the legislators who introduced these bills Senator Joe Boncore @ 617-722-1634 (#1*) and Rep. Jay Livingstone @ 617-722-2013 (#2*), and every single co-sponsor (1+2*). Please continue to call Judiciary members (#3*) and voice your opposition and/or email letters of opposition to James.McCarthy@mahouse.gov he will forward to all 17 members of the committee, hearing is not yet scheduled. Complete list of Judiciary Committee members with all info coming soon, for now all their info can be found via link #3*.

"This is community based art project to protest the incarceration of migrant children. 

On the border between the United States and Mexico, immigration agents are separating children from their parents. They are kept in buildings with no beds, no soap, no toothbrushes (and no parents. ) They wear the same clothes for days at a time. Many of the children don’t speak English and often don’t have any idea where they.

This is not right.

I want to construct an impactful art piece about this and I need your help. 

Please help me to carve 3000 children out of bars of Ivory Soap.  These “soap children”  will be installed in a room and surrounded by a chicken wire fence. They will each have an aluminum foil blanket.

My dream is that if enough people help me, we could make a line of soap children long enough to stretch the length of the Mall in Washington D.C. .

Directions: 

1. Cut a bar of Ivory Soap in two so that you have two long rectangles. You can use a wire to cut it.  If you’re not sure how, ask your grownup for help. 

2. Carve the soap so that the figure has a head, a body, 2 arms and 2 legs.  Keep it simple.

Please send your soap person with your name, your age and the city you come from. If you wish to remain anonymous,  just send your soap. I would like to collect soap from people all over the country who feel that Congress needs to address this humanitarian crisis.

Send them to:

Thank you for helping to call attention to the plight of these children.

"I want to post some of the ideas I want to implement, if I am elected to the office of District Attorney. I plan to change the culture of the office from ""win at all costs,"" and ""we can never be wrong,"" to ""let's obtain justice with honesty and integrity."" I want to expand diversion programs for first time offenders. Diversion programs take cases out of the court process, that's the diversion part, and put the offenders into programs that are designed to rehabilitate the offender. At the end of the diversion program, the case is dismissed. Currently, pre-trial diversion (PTD) is only available for misdemeanors. I want to expand the program to felonies, because many times first time offenders are one-time offenders, they don't offend again. The current administration requires people who want PTD to waive their right to an expunction, which is inconsistent with the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. I will end that practice, and allow people to obtain an expunction after completing PTD. Another reason for changing PTD is that I want to make this city more employable and able to attract good, high-paying jobs by saddling fewer people with needless convictions.  More people should be able to pass background checks than currently do,  and I want to make that happen. There are other programs, like the Veterans Court Program, that work similarly, and I want people to get their expunctions after completion. 

I want to work with other agencies to move mentally ill people out of the criminal justice system. Too often people with mental illnesses end up in jail because their families don't know what else to do with them, and the system doesn't have an adequate alternative. It's up to all of us in the criminal justice system to work toward alternatives to incarceration for the mentally ill. 

I want to decrease the jail population and lower taxpayer expenses by citing, rather than booking, misdemeanor offenders (except DWIs and Family Violence assaults, we have to book them into jail). Most big counties in Texas have moved toward this practice, and it is not expected to cause an increase in crime.

I want to regain the confidence of the people in their DA's Office by having a Conviction Integrity Unit, to protect against unethical practices in the Office. The new unit will be the beginning of a cultural change at the DA's Office, from win at all costs, to achieving justice with fairness and honesty. 

And I want to end prosecution of low-level marijuana cases, and bring this county in line with all the major counties in Texas. People, especially patients with chronic pain, should not have to worry about seeking relief from their pain by using an alternative to the side-effect laden drugs of the big pharmaceutical companies. 

This DA's Office can also be a part of the prison reform movement. First, we start by not sending so many people to prison. Also, there are interesting alternatives to the current model of a prison, such as the idea of Farms, Not Prisons project in Sierra Blanca. 

These are a few ideas I have, and I am open to more.",2019-08-13T20:13:34+0000,"Roger Montoya Campaign for District Attorney, 34th Judicial District of Texas",0,99,1000,4999,1,Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"**Say their names below! The supporters of these unconscionable bills have forgotten the Victims!! The 7000 plus human beings brutally murdered just since 1980 in Massachusetts deserve justice. Permanent justice not temporary justice. The justice that they and their families — the survivors — were guaranteed by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Court!
**Remember these names — Vote them out! Our own elected Senators and Representatives met with 150 First Degree murderers of our loved ones in Norfolk prison March 23, 2019 to discuss helping them get out — long before only one reluctantly met with 25 family members of their victims, at our insistence — yet they have never met with their own constituents to discuss these disgraceful bills! Let them hear your outrage...
Ten years they’ve been “working” to end LWOP in Massachusetts. They will never ever succeed — not for those convicted of First Degree Murder. They know not the wrath of the victims families. We’ve been to hell and back already. We are tougher then they are. We are stronger then they are. We have Said NO to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”!!
Obviously these lawmakers do not know the laws of the state that they represent. A sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole is not given lightly. LWOP is reserved for the worst of the worst. The 1074 inmates currently incarcerated for committing First Degree Murder are such. These cold blooded killers do not deserve the second chance they themselves denied to their own victims. 
The 7000 plus murder victims received a death sentence immediately. No Trials. No Appeals. No Parole. Ever. 
The 70,000 plus survivors received a life sentence immediately the moment their loved ones were murdered. No Trials. No Appeals. No Parole. Ever. 

Say NO to Elimination of Life Without Parole! Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers. Period.

Say NO to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”! Say NO to H.3358/S.826! LWOP means LWOP! #WeNeverForgetTheVictims #BeBrave #JusticeForMurderVictims

"QUOTE: From Dan Welch --- Dan Welch's latest for PressTV on the Hate Crime that is US history writ large.

“Well, Bernie is the latest to go on the talk shows and excoriate Trump and his racism etc, etc. You know, obviously it is absolutely essential to condemn Trump’s racist rhetoric and the disgusting sentiments that he stirs up but he is only lifting the surface.

“I think it is equally critical to make systemic analyses of the situation as it is. You know, just announcing this as one hate crime is, and to say that the Republicans or Trump are responsible for it is ludicrously hypocritical. It’s ridiculous.

“You know, if you wanna talk about hate crime, US foreign policy is One Big Hate Crime. The mass incarceration state is One Big Hate Crime. Exceptionalism--so many of these philosophies and ideologies that emanate from the idea of the US as it is are murderous... Are policies that actually kill millions of people.

“The sanctions on Iran, the sanctions on Venezuela, the embargo on Cuba—all of these policies are racist in orientation, and murderous in their intent. They are what Henry Kissinger said about Chile before trying to overthrow Allende, ‘Make the economy scream.’ That’s the point of it, medieval siege warfare.

“It is difficult to actually have any criticism within this two party system because there isn’t really anything allowed. One of these candidates are going to be chosen. And to be fair to Sanders, he is one of the very few candidates who does make sweeping, systemic criticism of US social and political economy but of course that’s the very reason that his candidacy will be denied if they can get away with it. They want Biden, or they want some sort of neoliberal continue to what they have been doing for last forty, fifty years.

“But this whole concept of the Hate Crime and to use one single issue to paint the other side, it’s just a diversionary tactic to avoid addressing the central issue. This is what the Kerner Commission said fifty years ago that America was drifting towards two societies, one black and one white.

“That is the hate crime. That is the overwhelming destructive and malignant cancer, a political crime that has been going on, that is part and parcel of what America is. That’s the discouraging thing when politicians say ‘this is not what we are’, oh, really!? Read a history book you jackass. This is exactly what America represents, and has been doing at home and abroad for its entire history.

“The wars are business. The military-industrial complex is a hate crime. We’re awash in the blood that our government has shed for the profit of the oligarchs. And nobody really wants to take on—or at least no one is allowed to take on that reality. It’s sad but that’s the state of things.”

"In 5 States, 1 in 5 Prisoners are Muslims 
Posted: 12 Aug 2019 03:50 AM PDT by Daniel Greenfield
At 1%, Muslims are still a small percentage of the population. But there’s one place in America where they are vastly over-represented. 
State prisons. 

Take Maryland, which has an estimated 70,000 Muslims, making up over 1% of the population. But of Maryland's 18,562 prisoners, 5,084 were Muslims. 

That's 27.4% or over 1 in 4 prisoners. 

It would also mean that 1 out of 13 Muslims in Maryland may have been in a state prison. 

Those are startling numbers, yet they come from Muslim Advocates, an Islamist legal advocacy group. Both MA’s numbers and the number of Muslims in different states may be miscounted, yet these figures raise serious questions about public safety and the toll that immigration is taking on our communities. 

While Maryland’s numbers are some of the worst, MA lists similar figures for Washington D.C. where out of 5,219 prisoners, 1,232 were Muslims, so that once again 1 in 4 prisoners were Muslim. 

D.C. does have one of the largest Muslim populations in the country, numbering between 2 and 3 percent. Even taking the highest estimate, 6.5% of the Muslim population in D.C. was in jail in 2017. 

Muslims make up 1% of the population in Pennsylvania, but 1 in 5 of its prisoners. 

Of the 48,438 prisoners in Pennsylvania, 10,264 were Muslim. That’s 8% of an estimated statewide Muslim population of 128,000, meaning that 1 in 12 Muslims in Pennsylvania were in prison in 2017. 

In 5 states, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, Muslims make up 1 out of 4 or 1 out of 5 prisoners. 

In another 4 states, Wisconsin, Missouri, Delaware, and Arkansas, they make up 1 in 10 prisoners. 

That’s a total of 9 states in which Muslims make up between a quarter and a tenth of state prisoners. 

The MA numbers are incomplete because the Islamist group only includes information from 35 states, but they do point to the scale of the problem of what Muslim Advocates call, “overrepresentation”. 

Overrepresentation may be partially a product of the success of Islamic Dawah or missionary activity in prisons. Islamic prison Dawah has produced many converts and at least some terror plots. And it may serve to explain high Muslim prison numbers in some states, but not necessarily in others. 

Delaware is a fairly small state with a population of under a million and a Muslim population of 10,000. Nevertheless, of its 5,235 prisoners, 516 were Muslims. That’s not only around 1 in 10 of the prison body, but also around 5% or 1 in 20 Muslims of the statewide Muslim population of the First State. 

The Muslim settler population is usually at around 1% in the country and its varying states. But in only two states, South Dakota and Idaho, was the Muslim prison population at 1% or below. 

The overall population, as MA noted in its partial numbers, was 84,882 or 8.9% of prisoners. 

Combine all those Muslim prisoners into a city and you have a population larger than Youngstown. 

The MA report also claims that 12% of federal prisoners are Muslims. (CAIR in the past had claimed that it was only 6%.) The current federal BOP population is 177,619. That would mean over 21,000 prisoners. 

And over 105,000 Muslims are prisoners in state and federal prisons. 

Using Pew’s growth estimate, which projects that the Muslim settler population will reach 8.1 million by 2050 (a severe underestimation of actual growth), that would mean a quarter million Muslim prisoners. 

This is not just an abstract statistic. It’s a compilation of human misery, lives lost, futures taken, a litany of abuse, loss, assault, and the accompanying taxpayer expenditures on trials, prisons and free lawyers. 

The current cost of incarcerating Muslim federal prisoners is taking $670 million a year from taxpayers. 

By 2050, the cost could climb to over $1.5 billion. 

In some states, inmate incarceration costs are much higher than they are in the federal system. In New York, inmate incarceration costs run to $69,355 per inmate. There were 7,838 Muslim prisoners in New York in 2018 at a cost that approaches $550 million. By 2050, New York would also be spending billions. 

Maryland is already spending over $225 million on its Muslim prisoners. Michigan is spending an estimated $265 million. New Jersey is blowing through around $250 million on Muslim inmate costs. 

Texas spends $191 million on its Muslim inmates. Wisconsin is on the hook for $113 million a year. North Carolina taxpayers face a $160 million Muslim inmate bill. Missouri taxpayers shell out some $70 million. In Illinois, it’s up to $180 million. Florida is blowing through $93 million. Georgia spends almost $30 million. And Connecticut is forced to spend over $100 million and Ohio spends $90 million. 

Even tiny Delaware is stuck spending $20 million on its Muslim inmate population. 

Pennsylvania taxpayers have the worst of it and are spending $438 million on Muslim prisoners. 

These numbers however are based on average inmate costs. Muslim inmate costs may be higher due to their special needs and special circumstances. 

Nidal Hassan, the Fort Hood Jihadist who murdered 13 Americans, ran up $548,000 in costs. 

But even these extremely incomplete numbers suggest that the federal cost plus the cost in 15 states approaches $3.5 billion. Assuming average state costs across the total population would mean a $2.8 billion cost to the states. (Although this is an extremely inaccurate means of calculating these figures.) 

But it does mean that by 2050, the nationwide bill for Muslim incarceration would approach $10 billion. 

Estimating the projected increase of Muslim prisoner populations can be tricky, but the rise in Muslim crime documented by the MA report still appears to be disturbing. 

In Colorado, the Muslim share of prisoners doubled between 2010 and 2018. 

In Utah, the number of Muslim prisoners doubled, and in Georgia, they tripled between 2011 and 2018. 

In Michigan, the number of Muslim inmates rose by almost 1,000 even as the general prison population fell by 4,000. 

In Missouri, the number of Muslim prisoners increased by over 800, even as the general population only rose by 600. 

D.C., Indiana, and Minnesota, saw share increases of between a quarter and a third. In Kansas, the Muslim prisoner share rose by a fifth. 

Texas added over 1,500 Muslim inmates even as its overall number of prisoners fell by 10,000. 

These are worrying numbers in an era where crime numbers and arrests have been declining. And they forecast the future of states which have consented to refugee resettlement without calculating the harm and expense that migration will inflict on their people, their children and their future. 

In British prisons, the proportion of Muslim prisoners rose from 8% in 2002 to 16% in 2018. 

As a report to the British parliament noted, aside from Muslims, ""no other religion had a higher proportion of representation in prisons than among the general population."" 

We have begun seeing similar numbers in the United States. 

As the debate over immigration continues, we must ask ourselves difficult questions about the price we are willing to pay to welcome in one particular group without caring about the cost to ourselves. 

How many thousands of lives, how many billions of dollars, are we willing to pay? 

And is diversity worth the price?",2019-08-12T18:18:02+0000,Jim & Madelyn Meyer,0,99,0,999,0.038788,South Carolina,0.067879,Alabama,0.146667,Florida,0.064242,Georgia,0.038788,Mississippi,0.099394,Missouri,0.072727,North Carolina,0.076364,Oklahoma,0.093333,Tennessee,0.232727,Texas,0.069091,Virginia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I want to post some of the ideas I want to implement, if I am elected to the office of District Attorney. I plan to change the culture of the office from ""win at all costs,"" and ""we can never be wrong,"" to ""let's obtain justice with honesty and integrity."" I want to expand diversion programs for first time offenders. Diversion programs take cases out of the court process, that's the diversion part, and put the offenders into programs that are designed to rehabilitate the offender. At the end of the diversion program, the case is dismissed. Currently, pre-trial diversion (PTD) is only available for misdemeanors. I want to expand the program to felonies, because many times first time offenders are one-time offenders, they don't offend again. The current administration requires people who want PTD to waive their right to an expunction, which is inconsistent with the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. I will end that practice, and allow people to obtain an expunction after completing PTD. Another reason for changing PTD is that I want to make this city more employable and able to attract good, high-paying jobs by saddling fewer people with needless convictions.  More people should be able to pass background checks than currently do,  and I want to make that happen. There are other programs, like the Veterans Court Program, that work similarly, and I want people to get their expunctions after completion. 

I want to work with other agencies to move mentally ill people out of the criminal justice system. Too often people with mental illnesses end up in jail because their families don't know what else to do with them, and the system doesn't have an adequate alternative. It's up to all of us in the criminal justice system to work toward alternatives to incarceration for the mentally ill. 

I want to decrease the jail population and lower taxpayer expenses by citing, rather than booking, misdemeanor offenders (except DWIs and Family Violence assaults, we have to book them into jail). Most big counties in Texas have moved toward this practice, and it is not expected to cause an increase in crime.

I want to regain the confidence of the people in their DA's Office by having a Conviction Integrity Unit, to protect against unethical practices in the Office. The new unit will be the beginning of a cultural change at the DA's Office, from win at all costs, to achieving justice with fairness and honesty. 

And I want to end prosecution of low-level marijuana cases, and bring this county in line with all the major counties in Texas. People, especially patients with chronic pain, should not have to worry about seeking relief from their pain by using an alternative to the side-effect laden drugs of the big pharmaceutical companies. 

This DA's Office can also be a part of the prison reform movement. First, we start by not sending so many people to prison. Also, there are interesting alternatives to the current model of a prison, such as the idea of Farms, Not Prisons project in Sierra Blanca. 

These are a few ideas I have, and I am open to more.",2019-08-12T01:06:36+0000,"Roger Montoya Campaign for District Attorney, 34th Judicial District of Texas",0,99,0,999,1,Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"**Please share! The beginning of the plot by Lifers to Eliminate LWOP in Massachusetts. I hope you are as outraged as I am reading this. Thoroughly disgusted. These are just a few of the 1074 currently incarcerated convicted First Degree Murderers that “hope” to reduce their just sentence of LWOP — and become our neighbors. Hope that their victims will never have — because they are dead. Men who slaughtered their wives and children — their families — their wives and children. Just a few...

“A bloody fraternity of the state’s most monstrous killer cons are plotting their releases from prison as part of a Department of Correction-sanctioned club whose aim is to shorten its members’ lengthy sentences.
Groomed by two men who murdered their own wives and children, dozens of lifers recognized by the state as the nonprofit Lifers’ Group Inc. convene twice a month at MCI-Norfolk and – according to minutes of their meetings obtained by the Herald – have focused in the last year on:
• Lobbying outside support for abolishing life without parole.”

What are those who support Elimination of LWOP in Massachusetts thinking? Are they nuts?! They must be — helping First Degree Murderers reduce the sentences that they received via Judge, Jury, and Supreme Court! These cold blooded killers are exactly where they MUST remain — for our safety! We cannot allow them to kill again. They DO NOT deserve the second chance that they themselves DENIED TO THEIR VICTIMS — OUR LOVED ONES WHO SHOULD BE HERE RIGHT NOW — FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WE NEVER FORGET! 

Please fight these unconscionable bills with us. Call or email all the Sponsors and The Judiciary Commitee members and SHUT THESE OUTRAGEOUS BILLS DOWN! Just click the links for ALL of their numbers and emails. It took the “Lifers Group” over ten years to bring these bills to our legislators — to the survivors — together we will shut them down in less than one...
Shame on the legislators who introduced these bills Senator Joe Boncore @ 617-722-1634 (#1*) and Rep. Jay Livingstone  @ 617-722-2013 (#2*). Please continue to call Judiciary members (#3*) and voice your opposition and/or email letters of opposition to James.McCarthy@mahouse.gov he will forward to all 17 members of the committee, hearing is not yet scheduled. Thank you! 

Opposition & Survivors Against Elimination of LWOP in MA. will Say No to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”. 
Because Murder is Inhumane and We Demand Justice for Murder Victims.
Because All Human beings brutally murdered deserve justice. Permanent justice not temporary justice.
Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers. Period.

"Jack Thomas Hamby is 13, and has lived with his father Darin Hamby, a Registered Nurse, since he was 2. He's been held against his will by his mother (who he's said is physically and emotionally abusive from age 3) since April 8th with the blessing and assistance of Madison County Chancery Court judge Robert Clark (662.834.1285)
Jack has gotten old enough to understand how dysfunctional his mother Shayna Russum, owner of Shayna's boutique in Ridgeland is, and had stopped going to see her. Her claim was that he had to have been ""alienated"", and the only way she could have a relationship with her own son is if I was incarcerated. Seriously. She asked for it multiple times in her filed motions, and repeatedly on the witness stand.
Clark decided the best thing was for Jack to be forcibly removed from the only home he's ever known, by men with guns, and isolated with his abusers. All contact with me forbidden by the judge and with his friends/family forbidden by his mother. This to continue until such time as Shayna has made ""substantial progress"". This in spite of the fact that the judge who presided over our divorce hearing for nearly 5 years had specifically stated that Shayna wasn't given custody because of her history of alienation of her other children, and her likelihood of doing the same to Jack.
Each and every day since this travesty occurred, Jack has used the only voice he has and refused to assist in his own programming. He's said loudly and clearly ""HELP ME!!!"" by not attending therapy, as the judge had reportedly directed the previous therapist what Jack was to be treated for and the manner of his treatment.
Jack was ordered (under threat of his father's incarceration AND custody ""automatically"" being given to his mother) to get ""therapy"" from Dr. Mark Webb (601.853.2676). According to Webb, the judge had given him Jack's diagnosis and treatment plan, and Jack had to follow it exactly or else. Webb threatened Jack with juvenile detention, among other things, in an attempt to coerce Jack. He failed. He encouraged him to go visit his mother anyway, in spite of being afraid, by telling him that ""My money's on you"" when Jack asked what he was supposed to do if his mother and her most current husband both started abusing him again. Why would the psychiatrist thinks it's OKAY to let Jack go somewhere with the expectation that he would have to fight for survival?!? When Jack clearly stated that he'd rather be dead than be put in that situation, and at the first opportunity he would kill himself, he was ignored. He told a psychiatrist that he was going to kill himself, and was dismissed by him. His mother Shayna laughed out loud and said ""Ridiculous!"". Jack was forced to see this doc by the court, and the doc billed at least $8,000 for his involuntary patient. No wonder he was so enthusiastic about allowing a lawyer to decide the treatment his patient received, in direct violation of his oaths.
He's also not doing ANY schoolwork, tests, etc at school, although he is attending. He failed school last year, despite her having him less than 2 months at the end of the year. He has maintained an ""A"" average his entire scholastic career. His earlier achievement test showed he was at college level on many subjects.
She's taken his phone, although she lied to the police and Jack, and agreed to let him keep it when he first went into captivity. She's also let unsafe adults in his proximity repeatedly.
Please, repost this, call, email, write letters, ANYTHING you can think of until Jack is safe. He's at VERY high risk!!
We're flying POW/MIA flags and have yellow ribbons around our trees and pins for our shirts. Please write him, if only to let him know people care what happens to him. The entirety of the legal system has failed him miserably.
Bring Jack home safe TODAY!!

As of 8/7/2019, Jack Thomas has served four months of an indefinite sentence with his allegedly abusive mother. Judge Clark knew about the abuse. knew Jack preferred to live with his father, ordered police officers with guns to forcibly remove Jack from his father, sentenced Jack to live with his mother against his will, denied Jack his legal right to have a Guardian ad Litem represent him, and has forbidden that Jack have any contact with his father - even though his father has not been accused of abuse or neglect. Since the judge made the order temporary, there are no additional hearings scheduled and Jack could be forced to live with his allegedly abusive mother until he is 18! Jack's ""crime"" was to love his father who has been trying to protect Jack from being abused by his mother and stepfather. How long must Jack be kept in court-ordered parental alienation?!?!?! How long must he be punished for loving his father?!?!?! How much is enough to satisfy his mother?!?!?! Please pray for Jack to be released from his life of confinement with his alleged abusers! 

We sincerely appreciate the comments and questions that have been posted on Jack’s Facebook page but unfortunately, everything that can legally be done to help Jack, has already been done. We hope that by listing the facts of the case here, you’ll have a better understanding of the corruption involved this case and the impossible position Judge Clark left Jack in. Jack’s legal rights were violated. Jack’s father’s legal rights were violated. NOTHING in the temporary order is legal or just or fair. You cannot comprehend this travesty perpetrated by the legal system until you realize that the law was broken, Jack’s rights were refused, common sense was nonexistent, evidence was ignored, and Jack’s mother’s allegation were the ONLY THINGS this case has been based on. No proof or evidence was considered in Judge Robert Clark’s decision to send Jack to live with his alleged abusers until he turns 18. Trying to make sense of something that makes no sense is impossible. 
 Jack disclosed that his mother (Shayna Russum Holmes) and stepfather (Jonathon Holmes) abused him.
 Jack’s father (Darin Hamby) sought help through child welfare agencies, law enforcement, emergency room, and therapists. 
 Trauma therapists and child welfare workers confirmed the abuse. The trauma therapist diagnosed Jack with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and dissociation (which happens during and after abuse and traumatic events). This proof was given to Judge Robert Clark. 
 Jack’s mother denied the abuse and chose to stay with her husband even though Jack said he abused him. 
 Darin tried to speak to the Madison County District Attorney about bringing charges against Jonathon Holmes for the alleged abuse, the District Attorney was not available at the time, so Darin spoke with the Assistant District Attorney who told Darin the case would be a “slam dunk”. We don’t know happened at the Grand Jury and no charges were brought against him. 
 Jack’s mother, Shayna Russum Holmes, currently has an outstanding arrest warrant in Hinds County Mississippi for allegedly assault Jack. 
 Jack refused to see his mother while the “creep” (aka stepfather) was still there. 
 Jack’s mother brought contempt charges against Jack’s father for not forcing Jack to go see her and she accused Jack’s father of alienating Jack from her.
 Jack was denied his legal right to have a Guardian ad Litem represent him.
 Judge Robert Clark of Madison County Chancery Court in Madison, Mississippi KNEW THAT JACK HAD BEEN ABUSED BY HIS MOTHER AND STEPFATHER AND WOULD BE ABUSED AGAIN, yet he chose to rip Jack away from his protector (his father), forced him to live with his abusers, and denied all contact with his father (Judge Clark reviewed all of the evidence but disregarded everything he had read and heard that proved Jack’s claim of abuse and that Jack’s father had not alienated Jack from his mother - and he ordered Jack to live with the very people he accused of abusing him and to be alienated from his father anyway).
 Dr. Webb (the court appointed psychiatrist) said that Jack would be able to fight off both his mother and stepfather (which was his way of acknowledging that he knew Jack had been abused and would be abused again).
 Jack’s mother has refused to allow Jack to have any contact with his friends or any of his father’s family.
 Jack’s mother had police officers with guns take Jack’s phone away and he has been denied access to email or social media so he has no way of contacting anyone if/when he is abused again. 
 Since April 8, 2019, Jack has been held in isolation, court-appointed parental alienation, solitary confinement, with the ones he said abused him. Jack’s only contact has been with his alleged abusers and their family members. With no contact with the outside world, his mother and her family have free reign over Jack and no one to check in on Jack to make sure he is OK. Isolating Jack from everyone who doesn’t agree with his mother makes it easy for her to try to break Jack’s spirit, reprogram him to hate his father and only love his mother, and brainwash him into believing everything his mother tells him and nothing his father tells him.
 No agency was ordered to follow up with Jack or make welfare checks to ensure Jack’s safety. No one, outside of Jack’s mother and stepfather’s families are allowed contact with Jack so there is no way to know for sure how he is doing. 
 Jack’s mother alleged, claimed, and believed that Jack’s father alienated Jack from her so she found a judge who ordered Jack to be alienated from his father until Jack no longer wants to live with or see his father. Jack’s father presented proof, solid evidence, 
 The court order is a temporary order with no date set for review. What this means is that this case DOES NOT EVER have to go back to court and Jack could be forced to live with his mother until he turns 18. 
JACK NEEDS AN ATTORNEY WHO IS WILLING TO FIGHT FOR HIM, TAKE ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE JUDGE, AND WE DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO PAY THE LEGAL FEES. PLEASE – IF ANYONE KNOWS AN ATTORNEY WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR JACK, EITHER PRO BONO OR AT A REDUCED RATE, PLEASE PUT US IN CONTACT WITH THEM. 
THANK YOU everyone who has liked, commented, and shared Jack’s cry for help and who has prayed for him. PLEASE continue to pray and spread the word!

"CRIMINAL JUDGES AS JURY OF ONE DECIDING THEIR OWN CRIMINALITY 

Here is a little dose of common sense showing you how ridiculous our legal system is.

A common problem in our courts today is judicial bias.  Also known as corrupt attorneys in black robes (aka judges) conspiring with attorneys to deny due process, and extort under color of law.

A litigant who is being subjected to a biased court can file a Motion To Disqualify to have the judge removed from the case.    In Tennessee state courts this is filed pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. Rule 10B, and in federal courts pursuant to 28 U.S.Code § 455.  Pursuant to Rule 10B, a represented party cannot file a motion to disqualify themselves, and it has to be filed by their attorney.  But attorneys will never allege bias against a judge they have to stand before.

And of course, judges never recuse or disqualify when they are accused of bias.

Think!  The ridiculous disqualification process is trickery, deception, and a confidence scheme. 

A judge who is biased in a case is conspiring with the attorneys to deny due process.  Due process requires an impartial judge.  Therefore, denial of an impartial judge, and being subjected to a biased judge is a denial of due process.  
Bias takes many forms; unlawful orders, ignoring perjury, relying on obvious perjury as basis of their decisions, using unsupported allegations as basis of their decisions, wrongfully excluding evidence, denying the right to be heard, case steering, and on and on and on…  These practices are unfortunately all too common in our courts today.

The injury or oppression of constitutionally protected rights, including oppression of a right of due process is a federal crime with a penalty of incarceration and/or fine, as defined in federal statute;

18 U.S. Code § 241
If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person… in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, … They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

So when you ask a judge to disqualify based on bias, you are either accusing them of a federal crime, or you are expressing concern that there is an appearance of a federal crime in progress.

Here’s the scam – guess who hears the motion to disqualify?  Yep, you guessed it… the judge who hears the motion is the very judge you are accusing of a crime.  Wow!  So now you have a person accused of a crime, acting as a jury of one, deciding their own innocence.  And again, when bias is alleged, corrupt attorneys in black robes pretending to be judges never disqualify.

We need to stop this scam.  We need a state statute requiring that whenever a motion to disqualify is filed, the judge must disqualify.  If the judge refuses to disqualify, the motion to disqualify must be heard by a jury.  We cannot continue to have criminal judges as a jury of one deciding their own guilt or innocence.

In the meantime, until we can correct this problem with proper legislation, if you are subjected to a corrupt and/or biased judge, go ahead and file a motion to disqualify.  But along with that motion, file a Jury Demand & Written Stipulation pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. Rule 38.01, 38.02, and 39.01.  

As state senator, when elected, I will continue to fight to preserve your rights and restore justice and equality for all.",2019-08-10T03:26:28+0000,John Gentry Candidate for State Senate,0,99,1000,4999,1,Tennessee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Senator Joe Boncore NO longer supports his Senate Bill #826 (#1*). At our last meeting Boncore gave me his word as he shook my hand and his Chief of Staff Anthony Gesualdi has given me his promise that they will request the bill go to “study” where it will “die” along with Rep. Jay Livingstone House #3358 (#2*) as they are entwined and will receive the same fate. They assure me that they have the power - and “seniority” - to make this happen. They are awaiting a reply from the Judiciary on their request for a hearing date, I will update when hearing is scheduled.
The Judiciary Committee has received an overwhelming and just response from the survivors and citizens opposed to these unconscionable bills. We have spoken loud and clear! They have been bombarded with phone calls and letters opposing these outrageous bills. You may continue to call Judiciary members (#3*) and voice your opposition and/or email letters of opposition to James.McCarthy@mahouse.gov he will forward to all 17 members of the committee. 

These bills will be shut down...
Because All Human beings brutally murdered deserve justice. Permanent justice not temporary justice. The justice that they and their families — the survivors — were guaranteed by Massachusetts Judge, Jury, and Supreme Court! 
Because Convicted First Degree Murderers do not deserve the second chance that they themselves denied to their own victims. 
Because the Survivors and the citizens of Massachusetts will ensure Justice for Murder Victims continues in the Commonwealth.

Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers. Period.

"Please sign our Petition and Say NO to Elimination of Life Without Parole for Adults convicted of First Degree Murder because:

The Killers of a minimum of 152 Massachusetts State Troopers and Police Officers (A-ie: gunfire, stabbing, vehicular homicide only), would be eligible for Parole after only 25 years and every 5 years thereafter.
The families of their victims would be put through hell, over and over again...

The Killers of the countless Multiple Murder Victims would be eligible for Parole after only 25 years and every 5 years thereafter.
The families of their victims would be put through hell, over and over again...

The Killers of the 7000 plus Massachusetts Murder Victims since 1980 would be eligible for Parole after only 25 years and every 5 years thereafter.
The families of their victims would be put through hell, over and over again...

Every one of the 1074 currently incarcerated First Degree murderers were convicted of the most heinous crime that there is and sentenced to Life Without the Possibility of Parole, these bills would make them all eligible for Parole after serving only 25 years and every 5 years thereafter. All sentences have been upheld and reaffirmed by the Seven Justices of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. First Degree murderers do not deserve the second chance that they themselves denied their own victims. 
The 70,000 plus friends and families of their victims  - the survivors - would be put through hell, over and over again...

Shame on you Senator Joe Boncore, Rep. Jay Livingstone, and ALL Sponsors of these unconscionable bills! 

Facts:
#1, These bills DO NOT apply to any inmate other than Adults convicted of First Degree Murder.
#2, Medical Parole IS currently available to every inmate if necessary. 
#3, The Appeal process IS always available to every inmate if there is due cause. 
#4, Massachusetts already HAS Life With Parole sentences for those convicted of Second or Third Degree Murder and Youthful Offenders.
#5, These bills DO NOT apply to Youthful Offenders convicted of First Degree Murder; (B) Any person who is found guilty of murder in the first degree who committed the offense on or after the person’s fourteenth birthday and before the person’s eighteenth birthday shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life and shall be eligible for parole after the term of years fixed by the court pursuant to section 24 of chapter 279, retroactively. 

Say NO to “An Act to Reduce Mass Incarceration”! Say NO to H.3358/S.826! LWOP means LWOP! #WeNeverForgetTheVictims #BeBrave #JusticeForMurderVictims Because a First Degree Murder conviction with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole means just that — The victims have Zero Second Chance — Neither should their killers.

"I decided to run for office after I was falsely arrested and detained 91 days for a crime that I did not commit. I learned from my own personal experiences the civil and human rights violations that happen every day across the criminal justice system.

I was blind to an unjust system that:
- Incarcerates over 2.4 Million and monitors 6.7 Million on probation a year.
- Allows for horrible criminal acts to take place within our jails/prisons 
- Profits from incarceration.

I decided to run when I didn’t have Health Insurance for my family and realized the thousands of dollars that we would have to pay for “High Deductible” coverage.

- America is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.
- No one in this country should have to choose between insulin and a car payment. 
- No person with a terminal condition should stop treatment to keep his family from going into debt. 
- Above all, no corporation should make billions gambling on whether or not you get sick.

I decided to run because “All Americans” need to protect our environment. The destruction of our environment is not a partisan issue and we need to stop debating the facts . We all live on this planet and we need to take care of it.

I believe in the hope for America. We come from all walks of life with our own stories to form a more perfect union. The values that bring us together are greater than the political talking points that tear us apart. Join me, and with some effort, we can make a country that works for all its people.

Black kids in NJ are 30 times more likely to be locked up than white kids. We spend way too much money investing in the incarceration of our youth rather than in building them up.

The survivors will not let that happen — ever. Countless lifetimes were forever altered, destiny changed.
*They had names — 7000 plus names-just since 1980 — imagine the total. They had families — they had futures — they were human beings — they had dreams — Just like you. Their entire life, their futures, were painfully taken from them by the hand of another, intentionally, on purpose. Permanently — Never to be seen or heard again.
*Their killers took it all away — brutally and viciously — a horrendous way to die — Murder in the First Degree. They took a life — or more — that they had zero right to take. Their actions cannot be undone, they must be held accountable and responsible. Permanently — Just like their victims. 
*The 1074 adult inmates currently serving LWOP in Massachusetts cannot be allowed to harm again. They were already convicted of First Degree Murder in Massachusetts, defined as; A Premeditated Murder, A Felony Murder, A Homicide that is Exceptionally Brutal or Savage. The families of their victims would be fearful for the rest of their lives.
*The survivors have lived with and faced this evil everyday since the moment their loved ones took their last breath. Life is difficult after a murder in the family — to say the least. The thing about murder — It’s never over — as evidenced by these unconscionable bills. We are forced to fight the system for every ounce of “justice” — over and over and over again.

"Washington works hand-in-hand with private prison companies, who spend millions on lobbyists, campaign contributions, and revolving-door hires — all to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe. 

While the Obama administration took steps to lower the incarceration rate and wind down private prisons, these companies got their biggest break yet when Donald Trump landed in the White House. Private detention centers have made millions implementing Trump’s cruel immigration policies, as the number of detained children quintupled in just a single year. Today 73% of detained immigrants are held in private detention facilities. Under Trump, babies are getting sick and dying from their detention centers. 

We need significant reform in both criminal justice and in immigration, to end mass incarceration and all of the unnecessary, cruel, and punitive forms of immigration detention that have taken root in the Trump Administration. The first step is to end this private profiteering off cruelty that stands in the way of big, structural change.
 
Here’s where I’ll start as president: Ban private prisons and detention facilities. If you’re with me, sign my petition to tell the government to keep the people in its care safe.",2019-08-07T14:21:18+0000,Warren for President,0,99,0,999,1,South Carolina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
