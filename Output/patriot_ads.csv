"Tonight I had the pleasure of attending the 2019 Central Louisiana Reagan Rally at the Country Inn & Suites. 

It was a true blessing being around like minded, conservative Americans. It was also a blessing to see three conservative college students, Caroline Drell, Gus Robinson and Alex Harrison, receive scholarships from the Republican Rapides Parish Executive Committee. Good luck in your future endeavors! 

The keynote speaker for the night was Benghazi Survivor and American Patriot and Hero, #MarkGeist. His account of the attack on September 11th, 2012 in Benghazi, Libya was riveting and was a testament to faith and service before self. Thank you “Oz” for sharing your story and being an inspiration to all of us!

"THE ALBUQUERQUE CITY COUNCIL WANTS TO TAKE YOUR GUN RIGHTS AWAY!

** 3:45 pm MEET UP IN THE CIVIC PLAZA UNTIL 4:15PM - BRING SIGNS, BRING FLAGS, BRING YOUR VOICE** 
(This is a peaceful assembly)

*** 4:15 pm  THOSE THAT WANT TO SPEAK TO THE CITY COUNCIL MUST BE INSIDE BY 4:30 PM TO SIGN UP***
(Please be respectful in the city council room and when speaking to city council members)
#StopRedFlag

**** 5:00pm the City Council meeting starts, so lets  PACK THE ROOM (It’s in the basement)  before they VOTE to take away our constitutional rights of due process!  This resolution is IN SUPPORT of the Statewide red flag bill which means a single accuser can make a report that you are a threat, the judge has 24 hours to sign off, and once that happens the SWAT or other law enforcement show up in FORCE to take your guns - you wont know about it until it happens. You will NOT have a court hearing before they show up.  You must pass a background check to get your guns back. This is a violation of our constitutional rights!!

Make sure you read HB 83 - the Red Flag Bill - that they tried to pass last session! 
https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/19%20Regular/bills/house/HB0083.pdf

**UPDATE** Lujan just announced she wants sellers of guns to ALSO get background checks - one step closer to gun registry!
#StopLujan

IF YOU CANT MAKE IT - please contact the city council member presenting this Red Flag Resolution.

Call,  write, email, or go visit Albuquerque city council member Isaac Benton and tell him you do NOT agree with this unjust violation of the constitution by passing a city wide Red Flag Resolution!

***Please be RESPECTFUL to all city countil members and employees***

I created an important petition, please sign!   
STOP RED FLAG RESOLUTION IN ALBUQUERQUE

Dear Fellow Patriot,

The Extreme Risk Protection Order, also known as the Red Flag Gun Confiscation Bill that we defeated last year, is being presented as a resolution  on August 19th in Albuquerque in support of the State Wide Red Flag Bill.

We also have word that Michelle Lujan Grisham will be pushing for the red flag bill statewide, as well as other stronger gun regulations at the upcoming terrorist summit in Santa Fe. 

A Red Flag Bill means that a single accuser can report you to law enforcement. That complaint is immediately taken to a judge, who without any evidence, will determine if you are a threat or not.  You will NOT know this is happening.  You will NOT get to defend yourself.  You will ONLY know when the SWAT team barges in and confiscates all of your guns.  There is no due process, and there is no legal search and seizure.  

I am requesting that you sign the petition NOW and share it will all of your friends, family, and coworkers.  We MUST stop this unconstitutional bill and resolution from ever being passed in New Mexico!

No Compromises!  
Stefani LordFounder/President of Pro-Gun Women
