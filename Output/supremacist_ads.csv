Media Matters and leftists attack Tucker Carlson advertisers, influence HelloFresh, Nestle, Stein Mart, Long John Silver’s and others to stop advertising.  Will these same companies stop advertising with Comcast Cable, NBC and its other affiliates after NBC Universal Pictures produced the movie “The Hunt” that shows leftists killing conservatives for fun?  Will these companies have a double standard? 

Media Matters reports that it has recently influenced several companies to stop advertising during Tucker Carlson Tonight.  The Media Matters article reports in part:  “This week, Long John Silver’s said it will no longer advertise on Fox News as a whole, and Nestlé, HelloFresh and Stein Mart confirmed that they are no longer running ads on Carlson’s show.”  Additionally, Huffington Post is a driving force behind the attack on Tucker Carlson.  Here is one  Twitter report showing HuffPost's involvement.  NEW: AstraZeneca confirms to HuffPost that they ""are no longer advertising on the Tucker Carlson show and we will not be advertising on this program in the future.""

Tucker Carlson has brought bold, fact based news perspectives to millions of Americans that no other cable news host has produced. Tucker Carlson Tonight:

•    Diligently reported on Antifa’s violence towards conservatives and suppression of conservatives’ free speech and free assembly.  On the other hand, The NY Post reports:  CNN’s Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon have defended antifa on-air. Chuck Todd (NBC) invited antifa ideologue Mark Bray on “Meet the Press” to explain why antifa’s political violence is “ethical.”

•    Repeatedly exposed Google’s censorship of Christians and conservatives.

•    Exposed MSNBC’s fake white supremacist labeling of President Trump including MSNBC Contributor Frank Figliuzzi who alleged the president delivered a hidden Nazi message.

•    Reported on NBC Universal Pictures’ recently produced movie ""The Hunt"" that depicts privileged leftist vacationers hunting ""deplorables"" (conservatives) for sport.  NBC Universal has cancelled the September 27, 2019 release date.  HOWEVER, NBC Universal Pictures reports:  “We stand by our filmmakers and will continue to distribute films in partnership with bold and visionary creators, like those associated with this satirical social thriller, but we understand that now is not the right time to release this film.”  Comcast owns NBC Universal.

Carlson bravely challenges leftist hatred and exposes the dangers that contrived and vitriolic leftist news poses to American liberties and public safety.  The word ""bravely"" is used here because his personal home and family have been threatened.

Media Matters claims to have influenced numerous companies to stop advertising at Tucker Carlson Tonight. 

So are the companies that pulled advertising from Tucker Carlson Tonight also going to STOP ADVERTISING on:

•    Comcast Cable, NBC and its other affiliates after NBC Universal Pictures produced the movie “The Hunt” that shows leftists killing conservatives?   A recent NBC Universal Pictures statement implies it will release the film at “the right time.”

•    CNN and MSNBC for defending and championing Antifa’s violence toward conservatives and their freedom of speech and assembly?

In light of these and other over the top leftist propaganda, advertisers need to show fairness toward conservative programming.  These advertisers need to be encouraged not to allow leftist vitriol to dissuade them from advertising on conservative programming.

Here are some of the more substantial advertisers that Media Matters claims to have stopped advertising on Tucker Carlson Tonight since the beginning of the year:  HelloFresh, Nestle USA, Stein Mart, Long John Silver's, AbbVie Inc, Ancestry, AstraZeneca, Bayer Healthcare, Bowflex (owned by Nautilus), Careerbuild.com, Farmers Insurance, Home Chef (Owned by Kroger), HOP (Owned by Dine Brands Global), Jaguar Land Rover, Just for Men (Owned by Combe Inc.), Pacific Life, Purple mattress, Red Lobster (Owned by Golden Gate Capital), Robitussin (Owned by Pfizer), Saatva Mattress, Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, TD Ameritrade and Zenni Optical.

Florida Family Association has prepared an email for you to send to challenge the companies that have stopped advertising with Tucker Carlson to return to his show.

"Words have power. Donald Trump has called Hispanics in this country an ""infestation."" He has called those seeking asylum an ""invasion."" And, there are those who heed his words. And there are those who massacre because of those words and what they represent. 

The real infestation is homegrown. It is those who are afraid and who hate. It's time our elected representatives put the American people before special interests. It's time they take note that we are more at risk from white supremacists than we are from Muslim extremists.

"Marcos moved to America from Cuba at 17 and is set to become an American citizen this fall. 

Because of his experience growing up in a socialist country, he is determined to teach his peers the truth about socialism—no matter what they call him. He's even been called a white supremacist by fellow students on campus!

"Hate crimes based on political ideology. 

The FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity or gender.”

A political ideology is a certain set of principles or doctrines in a social movement composed of a large group of people that explains how society should work, and offers a political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order.

The shootings in El Paso and Dayton have prompted discussions on mass killings, mass shootings, and hate crime. 

The FBI defines a mass killing as any instance in which four or more people are killed, not counting the suspected killer. So if you follow that definition, there have been about 30 shootings in 2019 that qualify as mass killings.

The Gun Violence Archive, an independent organization tracking gun violence, defines a mass shooting as a situation in which four or more people are shot. By this metric there have been about 250 mass shootings in 2019. 

We have looked at data over the last 10 years involving mass shootings and have found 18 instances that qualify as hate crimes based on political ideology. We included 2 standout incidents of hate crimes using weapons other than firearms. Below are these 20 incidents, with a brief summary to start. Please share any other incidents of hate crimes based on political ideology that we may have overlooked. The question is, should we as a society try to reduce hate crimes based on political ideology? And if so, how? Share your views at synthisophy.com!

Days after the shooting, reports in the media revealed that a Joint Terrorism Task Force had been aware of a series of e-mails between Hasan and the Yemen-based Imam Anwar al-Awlaki, who had been monitored by the NSA as a security threat, and that Hasan's colleagues had been aware of his increasing radicalization for several years.",2019-08-09T18:31:21+0000,Synthisophy,0,99,5000,9999,0.000413,North Dakota,0.023962,Tennessee,0.009502,New Mexico,0.035323,New York,0.029746,North Carolina,0.052882,Ohio,0.017145,Oklahoma,0.024995,Oregon,0.040901,Pennsylvania,0.015286,South Carolina,0.004751,South Dakota,0.073539,Texas,0.005371,New Hampshire,0.006817,Utah,0.021277,Virginia,0.036769,Washington,0.01322,West Virginia,0.022723,Wisconsin,0.005164,Connecticut,0.001239,Delaware,0.002066,Hawaii,0.002066,Rhode Island,0.003718,Vermont,0.017145,New Jersey,0.01384,Nevada,0.014253,Alabama,0.01508,Iowa,0.005784,Alaska,0.037596,Arizona,0.016319,Arkansas,0.066928,California,0.016939,Colorado,0.056806,Florida,0.020863,Georgia,0.00785,Idaho,0.035943,Illinois,0.024995,Indiana,0.014047,Kansas,0.00723,Nebraska,0.025821,Kentucky,0.010535,Louisiana,0.008263,Maine,0.009502,Maryland,0.014666,Massachusetts,0.048957,Michigan,0.01446,Minnesota,0.00599,Mississippi,0.032638,Missouri,0.005577,Montana,0.003099,Wyoming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"From the brilliant Isaura Jiménez Guerra:

“Yesterday ICE carried out one of the largest immigration raids this country has seen. The fact that our government has the capacity to continue destabilizing communities and tearing families apart proves that our government has never stopped refining the capitalist, settler colonial, White supremacist strategies that were used in order to found this country.

Capitalism rules everything around us.

There are accounts of the ways in which the U.S. cavalry massacred Indigenous people of all ages, not pausing until it was done in order to steal and colonize the land we now call “America”. Andrew Jackson argued that Native Americans did not properly know how to cultivate the value of their land. Forced relocation was another way that the U.S. government stole land, literally marching tribes like the Cherokee and the Ponca off their ancestral homelands in order to take it for themselves as people of all ages died in those death marches.

Settler colonialists kidnapped people from Africa, separating families by selling the children and family members of enslaved people to further disempower and isolate. The codification of race through slavery was one way that the ruling class sought to protect their wealth and sow divisions. These things are part of a longer continuum of genocide rooted in capitalistic greed.

Anyone surprised to learn that Hitler studied the U.S.’s policy of Native extermination and reservations in order to develop his own methods shouldn’t be. Anyone surprised that U.S. companies worked closely with Hitler’s regime, that IBM made special materials just so that they could be used in the concentration camps in order to aid in the categorization and mass murder of people during the holocaust, shouldn’t be. This history of sharing strategies and tools continues today as Palantir provides ICE with the tech it needs and Elbit Systems profit from providing their tech for border “security” in Palestine and the U.S.-Mexico border.

Capitalism ruins everything around us.

In one of the largest immigration raids this country has seen, ICE targeted the Koch Foods poultry plant in Morton, Mississippi. This factory was not just targeted because of its employment of undocumented people but because workers there have been organizing to gain better working conditions and put an end to abusive practices. Workers fought hard while their case was in litigation for 9 years before being settled last year. This is an example of how ICE is state sanctioned violence meant to destabilize and keep people afraid.

Last weekend the shooting in El Paso reminded me of the fact that his lack of humanity and ability to target Latinx people was a result of a long history of dehumanization that is at the core of this country. The family separations we’re seeing at the border and as seen yesterday as almost 700 people were arrested while their children were at school; are not new. The deaths of children in detention centers are not new. The use of armed forces to keep people in line and reestablish control while continuing to make a profit, is not new. The use of corporate technology to facilitate the identification and harm of people, is not new.

Today Jewish folks, immigrants, and allies protested outside of Seattle’s immigration court, while #NeverAgainSeattle shut down the downtown ICE office disrupting their daily operations and to call for the closure of all detention centers. This includes the NW Detention Center in Tacoma which is owned by GEO group, one of the most profitable corporations making money off of the imprisonment of people in this country. History isn’t repeating itself, rather the ruling class has figured out how to continue dividing and conquering for the sake of profit.

Think about who you support (Patty Murray accepted money from GEO group last year), where you put your money (Bank of America continues to provide billions in credit to private prison corporations), why you might think this issue isn’t personally connected to you. Never again is now.”",2019-08-09T17:43:34+0000,Brown Lives Matter,0,99,0,999,0.02381,Alabama,0.025298,Tennessee,0.035714,New York,0.026786,North Carolina,0.050595,Ohio,0.020833,Oklahoma,0.017857,Oregon,0.032738,Pennsylvania,0.004464,Rhode Island,0.020833,South Carolina,0.008929,South Dakota,0.068452,Texas,0.004464,New Jersey,0.008929,Utah,0.005952,Vermont,0.022321,Virginia,0.041667,Washington,0.017857,West Virginia,0.016369,Wisconsin,0.004464,Wyoming,0.001488,Connecticut,0.001488,Delaware,0.002976,Maine,0.011905,New Mexico,0.005952,New Hampshire,0.005952,Alaska,0.008929,Iowa,0.026786,Arizona,0.025298,Arkansas,0.06994,California,0.013393,Colorado,0.063988,Florida,0.029762,Georgia,0.00744,Hawaii,0.010417,Idaho,0.03869,Illinois,0.029762,Indiana,0.008929,Kansas,0.013393,Nevada,0.037202,Kentucky,0.008929,Louisiana,0.005952,Maryland,0.008929,Massachusetts,0.034226,Michigan,0.016369,Minnesota,0.00744,Mississippi,0.025298,Missouri,0.008929,Montana,0.010417,Nebraska,0.001488,North Dakota,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Marcos moved to America from Cuba at 17 and is set to become an American citizen this fall. 

Because of his experience growing up in a socialist country, he is determined to teach his peers the truth about socialism—no matter what they call him. He's even been called a white supremacist by fellow students on campus!

"Nearly two years ago, the largest and most violent public gathering of white supremacists in decades took over the streets of Charlottesville.

"TWO YEARS AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE, AMERICA IS MOVING TOWARD A RACE WAR 

 by Gail Sheehy

Our current race war didn't start with El Paso and Dayton.  It didn’t start with Charlottesville,

 whose residents grieve again this weekend on the second anniversary of the white supremacist invasion of that once peaceful college town.    

It started 400 years ago when the first African slaves were shipped to Jamestown, VA.

Its latest revival began before the invasion of Charlottesville. Months before the invasion,  probes by the white supremacists began to prompt police to use tear gas on its own residents.

""I remember it like it was yesterday,"" the closest friend of victim Heather Heyer told me. Lindsey Reisser and her boyfriend Carl Thomas had gone out of town to a concert that weekend. Her phone kept vibrating. She didn't take the call until the music stopped and a mutual friend told her that Heather was run over and lay in the street, stone cold dead. 

On hearing the news, Lindsey collapsed on the concert's stone floor. 

""What am I doing up here when my city's on fire,"" Carl Thomas moaned.  Lindsey’s African-American boyfriend broke down when he got back to work as a hotel room service delivery man. Carl told me that that day, ""When Trump says, 'We're going to make America great again,' I hear he's going to make America white again. In that America, my grandfather was beaten in the streets. Charlottesville is my town. I was born here. They can't hijack our city."" 

Today, I was among many journalists to sign on to a phone conference hosted by a coalition of Charlottesville activists. They are demanding that Twitter shut down hate speech and white supremacists. #ChangeTheTerms is their demand.  But how?

""This weekend marks the second anniversary of the 'Unite the Right Rally' in Charlottesville,” began  Jessica Gonzalez, co-founder of a coalition of 55 human, civil, and digital rights groups led by people of color, women, LGBTQ, white, black and brown activists. “Since then, our country has experienced white supremacy and violence in El Paso, Dayton, Pittsburgh, and well beyond. Twitter must acknowledge its role as a midwife for white nationalism.”

The coalition demands that Twitter ban white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and the violent extremists who organized the invasion of Charlottesville and are using their platform to energize the mounting race war. Twitter has hidden behind the false bromide that public conversations prevent hatred. 

The Charlottesville founder of Black Lives Matter, Don Gathers, hcacaad a strong response to a question from a journalist asking, “Is there a ban being called for on Donald Trump’s Twitter messages, many of which would qualify as hate speech?”

Lisa Woolfork, associate professor at University of Virginia, responded: “Change the Term has 55 members in the group; some are calling for that, but as a group we are not explicitly calling for that. “

Jessica Gonzalez added: “It’s notable that Facebook has banned white supremacists. Twitter has not.  I have seen Facebook purge many white supremacists off its site. Is it a perfect system? No.  Enforcement needs to be improved.”",2019-08-07T23:05:34+0000,Gail Sheehy,0,99,1000,4999,0.198205,California,0.005984,Delaware,0.002992,"Washington, District of Columbia",0.077786,Indiana,0.027674,Massachusetts,0.035901,New Jersey,0.103216,New York,0.132386,Ohio,0.104712,Pennsylvania,0.246073,Texas,0.065071,Wisconsin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's extremely terrible what's happened in El Paso and Dayton the last few days, and the loss of life is a horrible event. I'm sorry for the innocent people who died, and their families that are left to grieve. We hope these events never happen again. Not only in El Paso from a white supremacist, but also in Dayton from a Elizabeth Warren follower. [ 348 more words ]

"Is there any doubt now about the deadly consequences of Trump's election? 

There is a direct line between this weekend's mass shootings in Gilroy and El Paso and the President's stoking of racist hatred against left-wing Congresswomen of color and Latinx immigrants, his refusal to condemn neo-Nazis at Charlottesville, his cries of ""send them back,"" ""infestation"" and ""invasion."" Trumpism draws on a long history of racism, nationalism, and xenophobia in U.S. politics to inspire what are essentially modern day lynchings. And policy accompanies the weaponry: concentration camps on the border, the acceleration of voter suppression, the ""Muslim ban"" and more. As others have pointed out, white supremacist terror and white supremacist policy go together, hand in glove. And they are the battering ram for pushing through Trumpism's full reactionary package: roll back women's and LGBTQ rights, decimate the labor movement, deny climate change, expand the military budget and threaten war against Iran.

The bottom line: The virulence and intensity of this weekend's racial violence, ginned up from the White House, is a five-alarm emergency for the country and the left.

Debating the strategy and tactics for the struggle against Trumpism, and the role of socialists and the left within that struggle, have been at the center of radical attention and Organizing Upgrade's work over the past two years. Those debates - over the best ways to combine class politics with racial justice, internationalist, and feminist commitments, the possibilities and limitations for building power utilizing electoral politics, the balance of forces within and beyond the Democratic Party, the significance of increasing militancy among teachers, environmental activists, and others - will continue. The struggle against Trumpism will last longer than any electoral cycle. But we are clear that the 2020 elections, which are already underway, are a pivotal contest in the course of our struggle. Defeating the political bloc that is driven by white nationalism and has captured the Republican Party is our immediate responsibility as left organizers committed to the defense of the oppressed, the exploited, and the democratic space required to organize a movement large, united and powerful enough to contend for power and change the world. More than ever, we hold onto our belief that we can organize to win, if we stay focused on the scale and scope necessary to build real power. Let's do this thing.

In solidarity,

"Among extremist murders in the last 10 years, right-wing murders are three times more frequent that Islamic murders.  The proportion that are white supremacist murders has been sharply increasing. In 2018, every U.S. extremist murder was linked to right-wing extremism (mostly white supremacy), and none to Islamic extremism. https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/right-wing-extremism-linked-to-every-2018-extremist-murder-in-the-us-adl-finds. There is already a significant further increase in white supremacist murders in 2019. Yet, although Islamic terrorism is a crime, domestic/white supremacist terrorism is not.

Trump is wrong to blame white supremacy on mental illness. People with mental illness are not more violent than others-in fact people with severe mental illnesses are over 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than others.

"After a unexpected last couple of days due to white supremacist terrorist attacks we as a #nation mourn. So many individuals were taken away from their families and loved ones. Untapped talent and potential these people could’ve had and now we will never know, because of #assaultrifles, and people who do not care about the consequences.
•
#gunreform needs to happen now. One organization called Year-up is making sure students get an opportunity to use their potential.
•
Year-Up connects young adults who need opportunities with companies who need their talent. There is an #opportunity gap there are roughly 5 million young adults and about 12 million unfulfilled jobs.
•
With 4,700 students enrolled for the 2019 year, they all go though an intense six month training where they can enhance skills they have learned in regards of the industry they are interested in.
•
After those six months of training student have a six month internship. Students receive the opportunity to express their newly acquired skills at Bank of America, Microsoft, JP Morgan Chase & Co.

✅ Abolish DHS, CBP, & ICE
✅ Dismantle Systemic Racism
✅ Economic Justice

"7th Anniversary of Massacres of Sikhs by A White Supremacist in Wisconsin
CNN coverage on Sikhs after the shooting at Gurdwara in Wisconsin!

A white supremacist gunman, Wade Michael Page, attacked worshippers and killed 6 Sikhs in a Sikh temple, in Oak Creek, Wisconsin on August 5, 2012. This year is the 7th anniversary of this tragedy. 
Sikhism, the 5th largest religion in the world, has originated from India. Since 9/11, Sikhs have often been made the target of hate and violence in America due to ignorance about our outer identity of turban and beard. People think that Sikhs belong to the Middle East, Isis or that they are part of anti-American groups.

Sikhism preaches racial & gender equality, respect for all religions and that one should share one's blessings with the less fortunate and underprivileged in society. Sikhs have been part of America for the last 100 years and yet most Americans have no clue about the religion and its practices in which the males and some females wear turban as a symbol of equality and royalty. It stands for justice and love for all!

America lowered its flags in honor of these victims. Millions of Americans poured love and support to the Sikhs for which the community will always remain grateful.

We also believe that America's strength is due to its diversity and no one person or community should be made the target of hate or violence.
The six victims killed included one woman: Paramjit Kaur, 41; and five men: Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, the founder of the gurdwara; Prakash Singh, 39, a Granthi; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; and Suveg Singh Khattra, 84. All of the male victims wore turbans as part of their Sikh faith.

"7th Anniversary of Massacres of Sikhs by A White Supremacist in Wisconsin
CNN coverage on Sikhs after the shooting at Gurdwara in Wisconsin! 
ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਬਾਰੇ ਨੈਸ਼ਨਲ ਟੀ ਵੀ ਤੇ ਗੱਲ-ਬਾਤ ਅਮਰੀਕਾ ਵਿਸਕਾਨਸਨ ਗੁਰਦੁਆਰੇ ਤੇ ਹੋਏ ਹਮਲੇ ਬਾਅਦ! 
A white supremacist gunman, Wade Michael Page, attacked worshippers and killed 6 Sikhs in a Sikh temple, in Oak Creek, Wisconsin on August 5, 2012. This year is the 7th anniversary of this tragedy. 
Sikhism, the 5th largest religion in the world, has originated from India. Since 9/11, Sikhs have often been made the target of hate and violence in America due to ignorance about our outer identity of turban and beard. People think that Sikhs belong to the Middle East, Isis or that they are part of anti-American groups.

Sikhism preaches racial & gender equality, respect for all religions and that one should share one's blessings with the less fortunate and underprivileged in society. Sikhs have been part of America for the last 100 years and yet most Americans have no clue about the religion and its practices in which the males and some females wear turban as a symbol of equality and royalty. It stands for justice and love for all!

America lowered its flags in honor of these victims. Millions of Americans poured love and support to the Sikhs for which the community will always remain grateful.

We also believe that America's strength is due to its diversity and no one person or community should be made the target of hate or violence.
The six victims killed included one woman: Paramjit Kaur, 41; and five men: Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, the founder of the gurdwara; Prakash Singh, 39, a Granthi; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; and Suveg Singh Khattra, 84. All of the male victims wore turbans as part of their Sikh faith.

"Another week, another round of white supremacist terror attacks. We mourn the dead in El Paso and Dayton, and dread the inevitable news of the next attack. Another similar sounding manifesto, another Frankenstein document remixing the most atrocious genocidal rhetoric pulled from the darkest corners of the internet, alt-right 'white genocide' fear mongering, and a conservative party in the United States that has traded dog-whistle racism for a bull-horn and brazen calls that radicalize and enduce terrorist violence.

How did we get here? Like many of the issues I talk about, we must recognize there is a deep historical analysis we must turn to understand the evil violence that is occurring around us. White supremacist terrorism has escalated and become emboldened by Trump, but it is also, if I may be a cynical realist, as American as apple pie. The triplet forces of capitalism, patriarchy, and colonialism inform the events we are witnessing today. Mostly young white men, alienated by the cultural decay of late stage capitalism and social mores that reinforce the notion that they should be at the top of the social hierarchy, create a cultural powder keg that leads to literal, physical death and mayhem.

There is no easy ""policy fix"" for this. While robust education programs for white working people to expose them to analysis like that in this video would do much to fight back against white supremacist brainwashing, the best answer is more intimate. 

Talk to the young white men in your lives (especially and particularly white people). Have the tough conversations. Do everything you possibly can to make sure they do not begin treading down a bleak, hateful path.

"Another mass shooting, 20 dead, this one in El Paso, Texas. El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said “We have a manifesto from this individual that indicates a potential nexus to a hate crime, we have to validate for certain that this was a manifesto from this individual we arrested.” 

The manifesto, a document appearing on the online message board 8chan before the shooting rampage, spoke about an “invasion” of Latino immigrants and noted that the writer agreed with the shooter who killed scores of Islamic worshipers in March at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. 

Statement from Beto O’Rourke: ""We've had a rise in hate crimes every single one of the last three years, during an administration where you have a president who's called Mexicans rapists and criminals. Though Mexican immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than those born here in the country, he has tried to make us afraid of them, to some real effect and consequence, attempting to ban all Muslims from this country. The day he signed that executive order the mosque in Victoria, Texas, was burned to the ground. Those chants that we heard in Greenville, North Carolina, 'send her back,' talking about our fellow American citizens, duly elected to represent their constituents in the congress who happen to be women of color. He is a racist and he stokes racism in this country, and it does not just offend our sensibilities. It fundamentally changes the character of this country and it leads to violence.""

This shooting was by a national white supremacist, and is considered a hate crime and domestic terrorism. Remember the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting?  Remember Charlotttesville?

"The United States of America:

""A new report shows that 2018 saw a national rise in hate crimes, and that almost all extremist homicides were carried out by the far right.

Hate crimes rose 9% to a decade high of 2,009 in 30 US cities surveyed for the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE), headquartered at California State University at Santa Barbara, which published the report on Tuesday.

The rise is the fifth consecutive increase and the steepest rise since 2015, and the trend has continued to rise so far in 2019, the report said. The rise happened even as overall crime rates continued to decline across those cities surveyed.

The most frequently targeted groups nationally were blacks, Jews and LGBTQ people. The report shows that there was a particularly large increase in antisemitic incidents in cities like New York, and records 2018 as the “worst year ever for antisemitic killings in the United States”.

The report also stated that the total number of extremist homicides decreased sharply from 36 in 2017 to 22, but that “white supremacist” homicides increased to 17, and along with two murders associated with “extreme misogyny” made up the vast majority of extremist murders.

On 27 October 2018, in the lead-up to the midterm elections, Robert Bowers allegedly killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the worst antisemitic massacre in US history.

The increase in homicides around the midterm election was in keeping with longterm trends that the report points to regarding an increase in hate crimes around major political events.""

I’m absolutely shocked to find out that the Gilroy shooter was a right-wing White Supremacist. I’m jarred to hear that he went to a neighboring state with looser gun laws to purchase his firearm. I’m dumbfounded that Republicans are ignoring this to instead focus on immigrants. I’m baffled as to why there has been such a rise in White Supremacist terrorism in America and I have no clue what started it.,2019-07-31T00:59:08+0000,Man Without A Country ,0,99,1000,4999,1,California,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ORDERS DEATH PENALTY RESTORED
""Who says the death penalty is not a deterrent?""  Donald Trump, 2013.
Though a number of states have invoked the death penalty during the intervening years, the Government has not executed a federal prisoner since March, 2003. Five men will now be scheduled to die. To express your view, NotWe.org has set-up links to learn how best to reach elected officials CongressionalBest.com & SenatorialBest.com.

Presumably attempting to temper justice with mercy, while reinstating the ultimate penalty Attorney General Barr also directed that a single injection replace the three-drug cocktail in general use today. Pentobarbital, a gentle barbiturate long employed by veterinarians.to put animals 'to sleep,' is frequently used in states and countries that permit assisted suicides. The pain from the paralytic first of three lethal injections in current use, Midazolam,  is reportedly so excruciating that prisoners have requested death by a firing squad instead. The execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma in 2014  reportedly took 43 minutes while Lockett ‘thrashed on the gurney, writhing and groaning’. 

Today, most states administer lethal injections, however electric chairs and firing squads still exist under some state's laws. 35 convicts were executed in 2018 and 2019, all but two by lethal injection. Though 55% of Americans favor the death penalty, a 2018 Gallup poll revealed that only 49 percent agree that it is imposed fairly. 

Advocates decry: the crimes committed by these federal prisoners who are now awaiting death are heinous -- the criminals deserve to die. Criminals facing federal execution include Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist convicted of murdering a family of three, including an eight-year-old girl. Another is Lezmond Mitchell, who was found guilty of stabbing a 63-year-old woman and forcing her granddaughter to sit beside her lifeless body until, eventually, he slit her throat.

Opponents argue, often citing the Washington state Supreme Court ruling that the death penalty is unconstitutional because it has been applied unequally among different races. They add that most of the world's nations have abolished the death penalty altogether. Among 195 U N member or observer states, only 28% still observe capital punishment in both law and practice. Detractors contend that such punishments as isolation can be as strong, or even stronger, deterrents than death. Finally, they protest that by legalizing murder, whatever the reason, the government lowers itself to the level of the criminals it executes.

"About NAWWA

A new nonprofit corporation is being formed for the purpose of maintaining the equality of rights (including both civil and human rights) among “all” citizens of the United States in order to ensure their political, educational, social, and economic opportunities are upheld according to
each individual’s ability and the rule of law.

In summary, and as the name implies, the new nonprofit will help White Americans like:

- LULAC does for the Hispanic population;
- the NAACP does for Blacks or African Americans;
- the NAAAP does for Asian Americans;
- the NCAI does for Native Americans and Alaska Natives; and,
- the NHOA and NHPI do for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders.

An Introduction which explains the reasons for forming the nonprofit together with a Mission Statement, Vision Statement, its Primary Objectives, and the Aims and Purposes are presented in https://www.NAWWA.org/ as a “start-up” organization.

At this juncture, it is very important to emphasize that NAWWA is not a White Nationalist, White Supremacist, or alt-right organization. In fact, the format and ideologies of NAWWA are
replicated after and a compilation of the writings presented in the websites for the other 5 racial categories of people mentioned above. All of this is more fully explained on the NAWWA website.

In consideration of the civil unrest that the White Nationalist, White Supremacist, and alt-right organizations have caused over the last several years, it is anticipated that NAWWA can help eliminate such problems by providing the Whites with their much needed representation among all the other racial categories of people in America.

Therefore, it is hoped that you will help eradicate hatred and bigotry in America now and in the future by promoting the diversity and equality of rights among “all” racial categories of people that comprise our great nation. Please do your part by supporting and mentioning https://www.NAWWA.org/ to others.

Thank You and God Bless

"Eleanor Holmes Norton was born on June 13, 1937 in Washington, D.C. to parents Coleman and Vela Holmes.  Both her parents were government employees.  Growing up in a well educated and politically conscious household caused Eleanor Holmes to be very aware of the surrounding struggles for African Americans.  At the age of 12, she recalled watching protests against a Washington, D.C. department store which allowed black shoppers but refused them entry into its bathrooms.

In 1955, Eleanor entered Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio where she became heavily involved with civil rights work.  While in college she headed the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter and became a local activist working to desegregate public facilities in Ohio.  The emerging civil rights movement influenced her decision to enter Yale University in 1960 with the intention of becoming a civil rights lawyer.  In 1963 Holmes worked in Mississippi for the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).  She graduated from Yale in 1963 with a Master’s in American Studies and a law degree in 1964.

Eleanor Holmes moved to Philadelphia in 1964 to work as a law clerk for Federal Judge A. Leon Higginbotham.  The following year she married Edward Norton and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar as an attorney.  From 1965 to 1970 she worked for the New York office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  In 1968 Norton was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court where in her first case she successfully defended the National States Rights Party, a white supremacist group that was denied a permit to hold a political rally in Maryland.  Between 1970 and 1977, Eleanor Holmes Norton headed New York City’s Human Rights Commission.  In 1973 Norton organized African American women from across the nation into the National Black Feminist Organization... #blackfacts #blackfacts365 http://blackfacts.com/f/6025",2019-06-19T00:02:31+0000,,0,99,0,999,0.0625,New York,0.03125,Missouri,0.03125,Kentucky,0.09375,Georgia,0.03125,Arkansas,0.0625,Virginia,0.125,Texas,0.09375,Pennsylvania,0.0625,New Jersey,0.03125,Mississippi,0.0625,Alabama,0.03125,Minnesota,0.03125,Michigan,0.03125,Maryland,0.03125,Louisiana,0.0625,Illinois,0.03125,Florida,0.03125,Colorado,0.03125,California,0.03125,Ohio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Together we can stop the alt-right and put an end to Trump's white supremacist fantasies

Calling for an #AllOutDC mobilization against white nationalism and the alt-right July 6th

Where the alt-right rallies with hundreds, or even dozens, it should be met with thousands

On July 6th, two days after Donald Trump’s July 4th rally, the alt-right is planning a convergence in the DC at Freedom Plaza. #AlloutDC is calling on every one of good conscience to join us.

Speakers includes Laura Loomer, a banned Twitter-personality notorious for promoting Islamophobia; Mike Cernovich, who speaks openly in favor of date rape; and Milo Yiannopoulus, who harassed trans women at AU, taught College Republicans to snitch on the undocumented, and sang America the Beautiful in front of Richard Spencer giving Hitler salutes.

This rally isn’t about freedom of speech, it’s about protecting the promotion of hate and bigotry. Whether in bulletproof vests, police badges, MAGA hats, or in khakis, fascists thrive when we look the other way.

DC is not new to this. We remember the days before Unite the Right when Nazis brandished guns and Confederate flags in Southeast DC. When Richard Collins III was murdered at the hands of a local alt-right extremist. Where MPD resists implementing the NEAR act, for community accountability of police.

And in the suburbs, we see white nationalist sheriffs working through 287(g) contracts to kidnap, imprison, and deport migrants.

Right here DC, we saw the Clark brothers planning similar attacks to the Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue massacre.

If we want to live in a world where black and brown people are not locked in cages, or killed by right-wing police; where public safety is community lead. Where people from Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador are more free to move across borders than dirty fossil fuel corporations. Wherever state violence grows, we must support communities of resistance.

Not only will we deny the alt-right a platform, but we will also build the capacity to undermine the border, prison system, and welcome the free movement of people. Our collective vision for a world based on solidarity, support, and autonomy begins with our collective resistance now.

Together we can stop the alt-right and watch Trump’s white supremacist fantasies crumble once and for all.

###

In DC

Come out and support the coming #AlloutDC mobilization. Let us show why thousands of people greeted less than 20 scared nazis last year for Unite The Right 2. There are real alternatives in our community to xenophobia and white supremacy. Neighbors support neighbors at several Really Really Free Markets/free stores, communities bailing out black mothers, and communities welcoming newcomers. Our vision for a more free society where we share power and support each other is in direct conflict with the Proud Boys and fascists coming to DC.

It should be met with communities willing to defend the most marginalized.

Outside of DC

Hold a solidarity demonstration against organized hate and white supremacy. Mobilize against a new jail, 287g contacts, or funding line of private prisons/ICE detention centers such as Wells Fargo, Suntrust, or Bank of America. Organize a benefit to bail out black mothers, mutual aid disaster relief, resistance on the borderlands, or show the values of mutual aid and solidarity. Occupy ICE headquarters or police stations.

Each time a fascist shows up in one of our community lets show that community-led resistance and solidarity is a real alternative to authoritarianism, hate, and xenophobia.

"Professor Nelson asserts :As a Critical Race Theorist, I dare not argue that racism in the United States will meet its end, for racism is a consistent and persistent nuisance for Black Americans. I do, however, argue that Black people should take concerted and purposeful efforts to be both proactive and reactive both overtly and covertly to oppressive policies and practices, especially in educational systems. The integration agenda has not produced dramatic gains for Black peoples in the United States; thus, the time has come to consider other efforts - ones that both complement and/or replace the integration agenda - in the pursuit of educational equity. Perhaps, as Dumas instructs, we must no longer wait for superman since he is likely to come with another dose of antiblackness in education policy. The return to segregation, especially via enrollment in special education programs, might actually provide racial and ethnic minorities a federally protected right to education. Of course, the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education forbids the segregation of public schools on the account of students' races, but the Supreme Court has done very little to restrict the disproportionate enrollment of Black students in special education programs, which suggests that the federal courts do not see overrepresentation of Black students in special education programs as inherently violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Similarly, even the earliest forms of Critical Race Theory acknowledged a tenet of Black nationalism and separatism suggesting that Black people have long sought independence from an educational system built on white supremacist ideologies and practices. Thus, the Supreme Court's hollowing of Brown and the need for Black peoples' immediate and uncontested right to educational equity cannot and should not fall merely because Black peoples and White people are not learning in the same classroom or school building.""",2019-06-13T12:57:54+0000,Prof.V.Randall,0,99,0,999,0.097643,Unknown,0.010101,Vega Baja,0.006734,Manatí,0.023569,Mayagüez,0.003367,Moca,0.006734,Morovis,0.003367,Naranjito,0.003367,Orocovis,0.003367,Patillas,0.003367,Peñuelas,0.013468,Quebradillas,0.006734,Río Grande,0.016835,San Germán,0.003367,Salinas,0.006734,San Sebastián,0.003367,Trujillo Alto,0.006734,Utuado,0.006734,Lajas,0.003367,Fajardo,0.013468,Yauco,0.070707,San Juan,0.043771,Ponce,0.006734,Las Piedras,0.013468,Isabela,0.013468,Guaynabo,0.003367,Dorado,0.003367,Villalba,0.006734,Cayey,0.016835,Carolina,0.006734,Cataño,0.006734,Caguas,0.013468,Aguadilla,0.003367,Rincón,0.006734,Lares,0.006734,Juana Díaz,0.161616,Guam,0.006734,Texas,0.050505,US Virgin Islands,0.114478,Northern Mariana Islands,0.003367,Arkansas,0.003367,California,0.006734,Georgia,0.003367,Illinois,0.006734,Indiana,0.003367,Michigan,0.006734,Mississippi,0.006734,North Carolina,0.006734,Pennsylvania,0.003367,Rhode Island,0.003367,South Carolina,0.003367,Tennessee,0.006734,Washington,0.003367,Juncos,0.003367,Corozal,0.006734,Jayuya,0.037037,Hatillo,0.003367,Gurabo,0.006734,Guayanilla,0.003367,Guánica,0.003367,Comerío,0.006734,Cidra,0.003367,Wisconsin,0.006734,Coamo,0.006734,Canóvanas,0.003367,Camuy,0.030303,Bayamón,0.006734,Añasco,0.003367,Aguas Buenas,0.003367,Humacao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"You want to check out this argument against ""centrism"" or ""incrementalism."" I call it setting up the ball for Republicans to knock the ball out of the park in there want to take the country back to the year 1850.  Aren't we fighting the fight for a woman to have control over her own body again? I understand that there are differing viewpoints on that even here, but who wants to defend a government full of ""boomers"" that pretend science doesn't exist to make that decision? Or States Rights? We read here; we know that is just a tired dog-whistle for people trying to mask an evil use of the state to enforce their will on people long after the country sees the evil. It’s old and unoriginal.  Here is AOC. arguing that it is time to stop giving our reasonable values away to hateful, racist, sexist, bigoted dinosaurs. I'm with AOC, people who are sitting at home are there because they know we are just setting up for Trump 2, which will be worse because the sequel will get to learn from the present manifestation of the United States unwillingness to repent from its original sin. Look at the success of this one. A whole generation of movies, media, and the election of Barack Obama because he was the best candidate saying we will not compromise with hate and that is what makes us great. Now the tone is, “let’s see if we can meet hate in the middle somewhere. We don’t want to be divisive.” Hatred is divisive by nature, separating yourself from it, naming it, and declaring open war against it is unity for the righteous. Anything else is compromising values that ought not even be under consideration for compromise. We don’t vote for demographic changes in this country because we aren’t bigots that vote on whether a person must be white, black, brown, or etc. to live. That is what Nazis do and part of being a citizen of the United States is not being a Nazi. That was common sense and it ought return to being common sense.
 
The only compromise there can be with willful and intentional evil is evil. It used to be unarguable that hating another person because they were born a bit different from you was evil. Magically, that wisdom has been forgotten, except when it can be cynically weaponized by the very same party that has been soft selling bigotry as long as I’ve been alive. Everyone knows that is true, even the people that come lie about it. So, they come up with “post-truth.” If you shot a person, they are shot. If a white supremacist goes grabbing his gun and write a manifesto telling you the president is setting the right tone for him to hear what he wants to hear, and he wants to hear that he should murder for the “White Race” because he thinks that “their” women might choose chocolate milk as part of a Jewish conspiracy everyone he kills is dead. There is no debate that is going to bring our Jewish brothers and sisters back. There isn’t a bit of sophistry that will allow us to laugh with our lost Muslim brothers and sisters. No politician trolling on the floor of the house is going to bring back the smiling faces of the descendants of slaves that have now become regular victims of a problem that is obvious and undeniable.  Acting as if the same jurors’ parents didn’t vote the same way in the face of equally obvious atrocities is a denial of history as the survivors of that history stand witness. The shame of families seperated for fleeing violence and seeking shelter in the United States to be treated worse than prisoners will not wash off when we send the politicians that were elected on their backs to public disgrace, but that is where they must go if the flag is to be anything other than a byword. Evil and its compromises. 

As a country, a population has taught its children to hate In service to a myth we didn’t need and  to maintain policies that are quickly taking us right back to the time of the United States most long-standing sin. Although one of the two major political parties has found a great deal of success over the years through keeping those feelings and the tragedies that underlie those feelings at the four front, what it has cost them is evident as people calling themselves followers of Christ put a mentally unstable womanizer in the place of Jesus. Every Christian knows idolatry is the heart of all sin, yet you engage in it openly and just yell that you are not. The smarter ones will even bear false witness towards the people that point out this hypocrisy. But back to compromise. Take a look at the state of Trump and his party, then remind yourself that it started with a compromise with willful and intentional evil. Who are these people that are in the middle on this? I think we need to bet that they might be double agents or walk a different way so as not to get their ends. 
I’m tired of children killing people because we can put warning labels on rap songs and video games, but not hate speech. This is a capitalist economy, as everyone keeps yelling as loud as they can, if it is being done, then it is being done for money. Let us try to go forward with vision as uncompromising as the leaders that drug this country into the mud, for the things we all want the future of our children to be. At least if you believe that good can overcome evil. I do. And evil made some steps toward its vision, now let’s try good. Once, the country was coming out of a dark time and a generation passed the torch to the children hoping that they could fix all the pain and destruction. The “Boomers” got us a little ways. Now it’s time for the “Boomers” to do the same. Next, it will be time for another generation to do the same. It will only be that way if the “Boomers” lend their wisdom but pass the torch.",2019-05-20T09:31:15+0000,"Garland D'Juan East,am",0,99,0,999,0.027149,Alabama,0.001131,Rhode Island,0.005656,New Hampshire,0.005656,New Jersey,0.007919,New Mexico,0.020362,New York,0.040724,North Carolina,0.002262,North Dakota,0.044118,Ohio,0.023756,Oklahoma,0.019231,Oregon,0.031674,Pennsylvania,0.0181,South Carolina,0.015837,Nebraska,0.00905,South Dakota,0.031674,Tennessee,0.054299,Texas,0.006787,Utah,0.003394,Vermont,0.016968,Virginia,0.028281,Washington,0.010181,West Virginia,0.024887,Wisconsin,0.006787,Wyoming,0.011312,Nevada,0.003394,Montana,0.006787,Alaska,0.035068,Illinois,0.023756,Arizona,0.021493,Arkansas,0.036199,California,0.013575,Colorado,0.004525,Connecticut,0.002262,Delaware,0.032805,Florida,0.036199,Georgia,0.005656,Hawaii,0.006787,Idaho,0.035068,Indiana,0.045249,Missouri,0.026018,Iowa,0.020362,Kansas,0.030543,Kentucky,0.020362,Louisiana,0.016968,Maine,0.005656,Maryland,0.015837,Massachusetts,0.03733,Michigan,0.029412,Minnesota,0.020362,Mississippi,0.001131,"Washington, District of Columbia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
