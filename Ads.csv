1238,"Be a blactivist Join the We all know that black communities and Natives have always been plagued
by an array of issues that we have to deal on a daily basis Watching
Americas reaction to racism is very telling Last year police brutality and
racism have made it t the forefront Hundreds of unarmed black men and
women died at the hands of police officers
We are tired to feel neglected and ignored We all have had enough And now
we need to come together be honest and get the governments attention
We do not expect you to solve generations of inequality and oppression
overnight We do however expect you to come and to address the issues
and put forward a plan to make change",0.0,https://www.facebook.com/blacktivists/,0.0,0.0,02/18/16 05:30:07 AM PST,Black Tea Patriots Black Knowledge BlackNewscom BEING                                   BLACK or HuffPost Black Voices,New York,New York,2016-02-18,New York

Two months                                    before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two                                    sons.                                    Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of                                    his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in                                    Indianapolis at the age of 26.                                    Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what                                    authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-                                    duty firefighter.                                    The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest                                    Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.                                    Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old                                    sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her                                    off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of                                    their cars.                                    At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a                                    gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.                                    She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started                                    shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his                                    gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal                                    legally owned the gun and did not fire it.                                    Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began                                    shooting him.                                    ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley.                                    Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-                                    old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

Two months                                    before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two                                    sons.                                    Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of                                    his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in                                    Indianapolis at the age of 26.                                    Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what                                    authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-                                    duty firefighter.                                    The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest                                    Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.                                    Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old                                    sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her                                    off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of                                    their cars.                                    At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a                                    gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.                                    She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started                                    shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his                                    gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal                                    legally owned the gun and did not fire it.                                    Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began                                    shooting him.                                    ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley.                                    Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-                                    old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.                                    ""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They                                    have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley.                                    Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will                                    say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own                                    death, armed or unarmed.                                    #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether                                    #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice            Ad Landing Page https://www.facebook.com/Woke-Blacks-294234600956431/                 Ad Targeting Location - Living In: United States                                    Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., African-American Civil Rights Movement                                   (1954-68), African-American history or Malcolm X Redactions Completed at the Direction of Ranking Member of the US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence                                                                                                               P(1)0005753",,Chicago Illinois Indianapolis Washington,Illinois Indiana Washington,,Indiana
